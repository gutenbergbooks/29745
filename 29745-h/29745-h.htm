INTRODUCTION

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dcap">
Hermann Bahr</span>, the noted playwright and critic, tried one day to explain the spirit of certain Viennese architecture to a German friend, who persisted in saying: "Yes, yes, but always there remains something that I find curiously foreign." At that moment an old-fashioned Spanish state carriage was coming along the street, probably on its way to or from the imperial palace. The German could hardly believe his eyes and expressed in strong terms his wonderment at finding such a relic surviving in an ultra-modern town like Vienna.
</p>
<p>
"You forget that our history is partly Spanish," Bahr retorted. "And nothing could serve better than that old carriage to explain what you cannot grasp in our art and poetry."
</p>
<p>
A similar idea has been charmingly expressed by Hugo von Hofmannsthal in the poem he wrote in 1892&#8212;when he was still using the pseudonym of "Loris"&#8212;as introduction to "Anatol." I am now adding a translation of that poem to my own introduction, because I think it will be of help in reading the plays of this volume. The scene painted by Hofmannsthal might, on the whole, be used as a setting for "Countess Mizzie." For a more detailed version of that scene he refers us to "Canaletto's Vienna"&#8212;that is, to the group of thirteen Viennese views which were painted about 1760 by the Venetian Bernardo Belotto (who, like his more famous uncle and model, Antonio Canale, was generally called Canaletto), and which are now hanging in one of the galleries of the
<i>
Kunsthistorische Hofmuseum
</i>
at Vienna. The spirit of those pictures may be described, I am told, as one of stately grace. They are full of Latin joy in life and beauty. They speak of an existence constantly softened by concern for the amenities of life. It is just what survives of their atmosphere that frequently makes foreigners speak of Vienna with a tender devotion not even surpassed by that bestowed on Paris or Rome.
</p>
<p>
An attempt to understand the atmosphere and spirit of modern Vienna will carry us far toward a correct appreciation of Schnitzler's art. And it is not enough to say that Vienna is one of the oldest cities in Europe. It is not even enough to say that it preserves more of the past than Paris or London, for instance. What we must always bear in mind is its position as the meeting place not only of South and North but also of past and present. In some ways it is a melting-pot on a larger scale than New York even. Racially and lingually, it belongs to the North. Historically and psychologically, it belongs to the South. Economically and politically, it lives very much in the present. Socially and esthetically, it has always been strongly swayed by tradition. The anti-Semitic movement, which formed such a characteristic feature of Viennese life during the last few decades, must be regarded as the last stand of vanishing social traditions against a growing pressure of economical requirements.
</p>
<p>
Like all cities sharply divided within itself and living above a volcano of half-suppressed passions, Vienna tends to seek in abandoned gayety, in a frank surrender to the senses, that forgetfulness without which suicide would seem the only remaining alternative. Emotions kept constantly at the boiling-point must have an outlet, lest they burst their container. Add to this sub-conscious or unconscious craving for a neutral outlet, the traditional pressure of the Latin inheritance, and we have the greater part of the causes that explain Schnitzler's preoccupation with the themes of love and death. For Schnitzler is first of all Viennese.
</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>
Arthur Schnitzler was born at Vienna on May 15, 1862. His father was Professor Johann Schnitzler, a renowned Jewish throat specialist. I am told that
<i>
Professor Bernhardi
</i>
in the play of the same name must be regarded as a pretty faithful portrait of the elder Schnitzler, who, besides his large and important practice, had many other interests, including an extensive medical authorship and the editing of the
<i>
Wiener klinische Rundschau</i>. It is also to be noticed that
<i>
Professor Bernhardi
</i>
has among his assistants a son, who divides his time between medicine and the composition of waltz music.
</p>
<p>
The younger Schnitzler studied medicine at the Vienna University, as did also his brother, and obtained his M.D. in 1885. During the next two years he was attached to the resident staff of one of the big hospitals. It was also the period that saw the beginning of his authorship. While contributing medical reviews to his father's journal, he was also publishing poems and prose sketches in various literary periodicals. Most of his contributions from this time appeared in a publication named "<i>An der sch&#246;nen blauen Donau</i>" (By the Beautiful Blue Danube), now long defunct.
</p>
<p>
He was also continuing his studies, which almost from the start seem to have turned toward the psychic side of the medical science. The new methods of hypnotism and suggestion interested him greatly, and in 1889 he published a monograph on "Functional Aphonia and its Treatment by Hypnotism and Suggestion." In 1888 he made a study trip to England, during which he wrote a series of "London Letters" on medical subjects for his father's journal. On his return he settled down as a practicing physician, but continued to act as his father's assistant. And as late as 1891-95 we find him named as his father's collaborator on a large medical work entitled "Clinical Atlas of Laryngology and Rhinology."
</p>
<p>
There are many signs to indicate uncertainty as to his true calling during those early years. The ensuing inner conflict was probably sharpened by some pressure exercised by his father, who seems to have been anxious that he should turn his energies undividedly to medicine. To a practical and outwardly successful man like the elder Schnitzler, his own profession must have appeared by far the more important and promising. While there is no reason to believe that his attitude in this matter was aggressive, it must have been keenly felt and, to some extent at least, resented by the son. One of the dominant notes of the latter's work is the mutual lack of understanding between successive generations, and this lack tends with significant frequency to assume the form of a father's opposition to a son's choice of profession.
</p>
<p>
This conflict cannot have lasted very long, however, for the younger Schnitzler proved quickly successful in his purely literary efforts. The "Anatol" sketches attracted a great deal of attention even while appearing separately in periodicals, and with their publication in book form, which occurred almost simultaneously with the first performance of "A Piece of Fiction" at a Viennese theater, their author was hailed as one of the most promising among the younger men. From that time he has been adding steadily to his output and his reputation. When his collected works were issued in 1912, these included four volumes of plays and three volumes of novels and stories. Since then he has finished another play and two volumes of prose sketches.
</p>
<p>
It is rare to find an author turning with such regularity from the epic to the dramatic form and back again. And it is still more rare to find him so thoroughly at home and successful in both fields. In Schnitzler's case these two parallel veins have mutually supported and developed each other. Time and again he has treated the same theme first in one form and then in another. And not infrequently he has introduced characters from his plays into his stories, and vice versa. A careful study of his other works would undoubtedly assist toward a better understanding of his plays, but I do not regard such a study essential for the purpose. It is my belief that Schnitzler has given himself most fully and most typically in his dramatic authorship, and it is to this side of his creative production I must confine myself here.
</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>
"Anatol" is nothing but seven sketches in dramatic form, each sketch picturing a new love affair of the kind supposed to be especially characteristic of Viennese life. The man remains the same in all these light adventures. The woman is always a different one. The story is of the kind always accompanying such circumstances&#8212;one of waxing or waning attraction, of suspicion and jealousy, of incrimination and recrimination, of intrigue and counter-intrigue. The atmosphere is realistic, but the actuality implied is sharply limited and largely superficial. There is little attempt at getting down to the roots of things. There is absolutely no tendency or thesis. The story is told for the sake of the story, and its chief redeeming quality lies in the grace and charm and verve with which it is told. These were qualities that immediately won the public's favor when "Anatol" first appeared. And to some extent it must be counted unfortunate that the impression made by those qualities was so deep and so lasting. There has been a strong tendency observable, both within and outside the author's native country, to regard him particularly as the creator of
<i>
Anatol</i>, and to question, if not to resent, his inevitable and unmistakable growth beyond that pleasing, but not very significant starting point.
</p>
<p>
And yet his next dramatic production, which was also his first serious effort as a playwright, ought to have proved sufficient warning that he was moved by something more than a desire to amuse. "A Piece of Fiction" (<i>Das M&#228;rchen</i>) must be counted a failure and, in some ways, a step backward. But its very failure is a promise of greater things to come. It lacks the grace and facility of "Anatol." Worse still, it lacks the good-humor and subtle irony of those first sketches. Instead it has purpose and a serious outlook on life. The "piece of fiction" refers to the "fallen" woman&#8212;to the alleged impossibility for any decent man to give his whole trust to a woman who has once strayed from the straight path.
<i>
Fedor Denner
</i>
denounces this attitude in the presence of a young girl who loves him and is loved by him, but who belongs to the category of women under discussion. When he learns her history, he struggles vainly to resist the feelings of distrust and jealousy which he had declared absurd a little while earlier. And the two are forced at last to walk their different ways. Unfortunately the dialogue is heavy and stilted. The play is a tract rather than a piece of art, and the tirades of
<i>
Fedor
</i>
are equally unconvincing when he speaks for or against that "fiction" which is killing both his own and the girl's hope of happiness in mutual love. Yet the play marks a step forward in outlook and spirit.
</p>
<p>
Schnitzler's interest in hypnotism, which had asserted itself in the first scene of "Anatol," appears again in the little verse-play, "Paracelsus," which followed. But this time he used it to more purpose. By the help of it, a woman's innermost soul is laid bare, and some very interesting light is shed on the workings of the human mind in general.
</p>
<p>
"Amours" (<i>Liebelei</i>) may be regarded as a cross, or a compromise, between "Anatol" and "A Piece of Fiction." The crudeness of speech marking the latter play has given room to a very incisive dialogue, that carries the action forward with unfailing precision. Some of the temporarily dropped charm has been recovered, and the gain in sincerity has been preserved. "Amours" seems to be the first one of a series of plays dealing with the reverse of the gay picture presented in "Anatol." A young man is having a love affair with two women at the same time, one of them married, the other one a young girl with scant knowledge of the world. Yet she knows enough to know what she is doing, and she has sufficient strength of mind to rise above a sense of guilt, though she is more prone to be the victim of fear. Then the married woman's husband challenges the young man, who is killed. And the girl takes her own life, not because her lover is dead, not because of anything she has done, but because his death for the sake of another woman renders her own faith in him meaningless.
</p>
<p>
"Outside the Game Laws" (<i>Freiwild</i>) is another step ahead&#8212;the first play, I think, where the real Arthur Schnitzler, the author of "The Lonely Way" and "Countess Mizzie," reveals himself. It has a thesis, but this is implied rather than obtruded. In style and character-drawing it is realistic in the best sense. It shows already the typical Schnitzlerian tendency of dealing with serious questions&#8212;with questions of life and death&#8212;in a casual fashion, as if they were but problems of which road to follow or which shop to enter. It has one fault that must appear as such everywhere, namely, a division of purpose. When the play starts, one imagines that those "outside the game laws" are the women of the stage, who are presented as the legitimate prey of any man caring to hunt them. As the play goes on, that starting point is almost lost sight of, and it becomes more and more plain that those "outside the game laws" are sensible, decent men who refuse to submit to the silly dictates of the dueling code. But what I have thus named a fault is mostly theoretical, and does not mar the effective appeal of the play. What must appear as a more serious shortcoming from an American viewpoint is the local nature of the evil attacked, which lessens the universal validity of the work.
</p>
<p>
"Change Partners!" (<i>Reigen</i>) was produced about the same time as "Outside the Game Laws," but was not printed until 1900, and then only privately. Yet those ten dialogues provoked from the first a storm which seriously threatened Schnitzler's growing reputation and popularity. When Vienna finds a work immoral, one may look for something dreadful. And the work in question attempts a degree of naturalism rarely equaled in France even. Yet those dialogues are anything but immoral in spirit. They introduce ten men and as many women. The man of one scene reappears with a new woman in the next, and then that woman figures as the partner of a new man in the third scene. The story is always the same (except in the final dialogue): desire, satisfaction, indifference. The idea underlying this "ring dance," as the title means literally, is the same one that recurs under a much more attractive aspect in "Countess Mizzie." It is the linking together of the entire social organism by man's natural cravings. And as a document bearing on the psychology of sex "Change Partners!" has not many equals.
</p>
<p>
In "The Legacy" (<i>Das Verm&#228;chtnis</i>) we meet with a forcible presentation and searching discussion of the world's attitude toward those ties that have been established without social sanction. A young man is brought home dying, having been thrown from his horse. He compels his parents to send for his mistress and their little boy, and he hands both over to the care of his family. That is his "legacy." The family tries hard to rise to this unexpected situation and fails miserably&#8212;largely, it must be confessed, thanks to the caddish attitude of a self-made physician who wants to marry the dead man's sister. The second act ends with the death of the little boy; the third, with the disappearance and probable suicide of his mother. The dead man's sister cries out: "Everything that was his is sacred to us, but the one living being who meant more to him than all of us is driven out of our home." The one ray of light offered is that the sister sees through the man who has been courting her and sends him packing. It is noticeable in this play, as in others written by Schnitzler, that the attitude of the women is more sensible and tolerant than that of the men.
</p>
<p>
The physician is one of the few members of that profession whom the author has painted in an unfavorable light. There is hardly one full-length play of his in which at least one representative of the medical profession does not appear. And almost invariably they seem destined to act as the particular mouthpieces of the author. In a play like "The Lonely Way," for instance, the life shown is the life lived by men and women observed by Schnitzler. The opinions expressed are the opinions of that sort of men and women under the given circumstances. The author neither approves nor disapproves when he makes each character speak in accordance with his own nature. But like most creative artists, he has felt the need of stating his own view of the surrounding throng. This he seems usually to do through the mouth of men like
<i>
Dr. Reumann
</i>
in the play just mentioned, or
<i>
Dr. Mauer
</i>
in "The Vast Country." And the attitude of those men shows a strange mingling of disapproval and forbearance, which undoubtedly comes very near being Schnitzler's own.
</p>
<p>
The little one-act play "The Life Partner" (<i>Die Gef&#228;hrtin</i>) is significant mainly as a study for bigger canvases developing the same theme: the veil that hides the true life of man and woman alike from the partner. And the play should really be named "The Life Partner That Was Not." Another one-act play, "The Green Cockatoo," is laid at Paris. Its action takes place on the evening of July 14, 1789&#8212;the fall of the Bastille and the birth of the Revolution. It presents a wonderful picture of social life at the time&#8212;of the average human being's unconsciousness of the great events taking place right under his nose.
</p>
<p>
"The Veil of Beatrice," a verse play in five acts, takes us to Bologna in the year 1500, when Cesare Borgia was preparing to invest the city in order to oust its tyrant, Giovanni Bentivoglio (named Lionardo in the play), and add it to the Papal possessions. All the acts take place in one night. The fundamental theme is one dear to Schnitzler&#8212;the flaming up of passion under the shadow of impending death. The whole city, with the duke leading, surrenders to this outburst, the spirit of which finds its symbol in a ravishingly beautiful girl,
<i>
Beatrice Nardi</i>, who seems fated to spread desire and death wherever she appears. With her own death at dawn, the city seems to wake as from a nightmare to face the enemy already at the gates. The play holds much that is beautiful and much that is disappointing. To me its chief importance lies in the fact that it marks a breaking-point between the period when Schnitzler was trying to write "with a purpose," and that later and greater period when he has learned how to treat life sincerely and seriously without other purpose than to present it as it is. That was his starting point in "Anatol," but then he was not yet ready for the realism that must be counted the highest of all: the realism that has no tendency and preaches no lesson, but from which we draw our own lessons as we draw them from life itself in moments of unusual lucidity.
</p>
<p>
"Hours of Life" (<i>Lebendige Stunden</i>), which has given its name to a volume of four one-act plays, may be described as a mental duel between two sharply opposed temperaments&#8212;the practical and the imaginative. An elderly woman, long an invalid, has just died, and a letter to the man who has loved and supported her during her final years reveals the fact that she has taken her own life because she feared that the thought of her was preventing her son, a poet, from working. The duel is between that son and the man who has befriended his mother. The play constitutes a scathing arraignment of the artistic temperament. Bernard Shaw himself has never penned a more bitter one. "Even if you were the world's greatest genius," the old man cries to the young one, "all your scribbling would be worthless in comparison with a single one of those hours of real life that saw your mother seated in that chair, talking to us, or merely listening, perhaps."
</p>
<p>
The most important of those four one-act plays, however, is "End of the Carnival" (<i>Die letzten Masken</i>). An old journalist, a might-have-been, dying in a hospital, sends for a life-long friend, a successful poet, whom he hates because of his success. All he thinks of is revenge, of getting even, and he means to achieve this end by disclosing to the poet the faithlessness of his wife. Once she had been the mistress of the dying man, and that seems to him his one triumph in life. But when the poet arrives and begins to talk of the commonplaces of daily life, of petty gossip, petty intrigues, and petty jealousies, then the dying man suddenly sees the futility of the whole thing. To him, who has one foot across the final threshold, it means nothing, and he lets his friend depart without having told him anything. There is a curious recurrence of the same basic idea in "Professor Bernhardi," where the central figure acquires a similar sense of our ordinary life's futility by spending two months in jail.
</p>
<p>
To what extent Schnitzler has studied and been impressed by Nietzsche I don't know, but the thought underlying "The Lady With the Dagger" is distinctly Nietzschean. It implies not only a sense of our having lived before, of having previously stood in the same relationship to the people now surrounding us, but of being compelled to repeat our past experience, even if a sudden flash of illumination out of the buried past should reveal to us its predestined fatal termination. This idea meets us again in the first act of "The Lonely Way." The fourth of those one-act plays, "Literature," is what Schnitzler has named it&#8212;a farce&#8212;but delightfully clever and satirical.
</p>
<p>
Those four plays, and the group of three others published under the common title of "Puppets" (<i>Marionetten</i>), are, next to "Anatol," the best known works of Schnitzler's outside of Austria and Germany. They deserve their wide reputation, too, for there is nothing quite like them in the modern drama. Yet I think they have been over-estimated in comparison with the rest of Schnitzler's production. "The Puppet Player," "The Gallant Cassian" and "The Greatest Show of All" (<i>Zum grossen Wurstel</i>) have charm and brightness and wit. But in regard to actual significance they cannot compare with plays like "The Lonely Way," for instance.
</p>
<p>
The three plays comprised in the volume named "Puppets" constitute three more exemplifications of the artistic temperament, which again fares badly at the hands of their author. And yet he has more than one telling word to say in defense of that very temperament. That these plays, like "Hours of Life" and "Literature," are expressive of the inner conflict raging for years within the playwright's own soul, I take for granted. And they seem to reflect moments when Schnitzler felt that, in choosing poetry rather than medicine for his life work, he had sacrificed the better choice. And yet they do not show any regrets, but rather a slightly ironical self-pity. A note of irony runs through everything that Schnitzler has written, constituting one of the main attractions of his art, and it is the more acceptable because the point of it so often turns against the writer himself.
</p>
<p>
"The Puppet Player" is a poet who has ceased writing in order to use human beings for his material. He thinks that he is playing with their destinies as if they were so many puppets. And the little drama shows how his accidental interference has created fates stronger and happier than his own&#8212;fates lying wholly outside his power. The play suffers from a tendency to exaggerated subtlety which is one of Schnitzler's principal dangers, though it rarely asserts itself to such an extent that the enjoyment of his work is spoiled by it.

His self-irony reaches its climax in the one-act play which I have been forced to name "The Greatest Show of All" because the original title (<i>Zum grossen Wurstel</i>) becomes meaningless in English. There he proceeds with reckless abandon to ridicule his own work as well as the inflated importance of all imaginative creation. But to even up the score, he includes the public, as representative of ordinary humanity, among the objects of his sarcasms. And in the end all of us&#8212;poets, players, and spectators&#8212;are exposed as mere puppets. The same thought recurs to some extent in "The Gallant Cassian," which is otherwise a piece of sheer fun&#8212;the slightest of Schnitzler's dramatic productions, perhaps, but not without the accustomed Schnitzlerian sting.
</p>
<p>
When, after reading all the preceding plays, one reaches "The Lonely Way" (<i>Der einsame Weg</i>), it is hard to escape an impression of everything else having been nothing but a preparation. It is beyond all doubt Schnitzler's greatest and most powerful creation so far, representing a tremendous leap forward both in form and spirit. It has less passion than "The Call of Life," less subtlety than "Intermezzo," less tolerance than "Countess Mizzie." Instead it combines in perfect balance all the best qualities of those three plays&#8212;each dominant feature reduced a little to give the others scope as well. It is a wonderful specimen of what might be called the new realism&#8212;of that realism which is paying more attention to spiritual than to material actualities. Yet it is by no means lacking in the more superficial verisimilitude either. Its character-drawing and its whole atmosphere are startlingly faithful to life, even though the life portrayed may represent a clearly defined and limited phase of universal human existence.
</p>
<p>
The keynote of the play lies in
<i>
Sala's
</i>
words to
<i>
Julian
</i>
in the closing scene of the fourth act: "The process of aging must needs be a lonely one to our kind." That's the main theme&#8212;not a thesis to be proved. This loneliness to which
<i>
Sala
</i>
refers, is common to all people, but it is more particularly the share of those who, like himself and
<i>
Julian</i>, have treasured their "freedom" above everything else and who, for that reason, have eschewed the human ties which to a man like
<i>
Wegrath
</i>
represent life's greatest good and deepest meaning. Again we find the principal characters of the play typifying the artistic temperament, with its unhuman disregards of the relationships that have primary importance to other men. Its gross egoism, as exemplified by
<i>
Julian</i>, is the object of passionate derision. And yet it is a man of that kind,
<i>
Sala</i>, who recognizes and points out the truer path, when he say: "To love is to live for somebody else."
</p>
<p>
The play has no thesis, as I have already said. It is not poised on the point of a single idea. Numerous subordinate themes are woven into the main one, giving the texture of the whole a richness resembling that of life itself. Woman's craving for experience and self-determination is one such theme, which we shall find again in "Intermezzo," where it practically becomes the dominant one.
</p>
<p>
Another one is that fascinated stare at death which is so characteristic of Latin and Slav writers&#8212;of men like Zola, Maupassant, and Tolstoy&#8212;while it is significantly absent in the great Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon poets. "Is there ever a blissful moment in any decent man's life, when he can think of anything but death in his innermost soul?" says
<i>
Sala</i>. The same thought is expressed in varying forms by one after another of Schnitzler's characters. "All sorrow is a lie as long as the open grave is not your own," cries the dying
<i>
Catharine
</i>
in "The Call of Life." It is in this connection particularly that we of the North must bear in mind Schnitzler's Viennese background and the Latin traditions forming such a conspicuous part of it. The Latin peoples have shown that they can die as bravely as the men of any other race or clime, but their attitude toward death in general is widely different from the attitude illustrated by Ibsen or Strindberg, for instance. A certain gloom, having kinship with death, seems ingrained in the Northern temperament, put there probably by the pressure of the Northern winter. The man of the sunlit South, on the other hand, seems always to retain the child's simple horror at the thought that darkness must follow light. We had better not regard it as cowardice under any circumstances, and cowardice it can certainly not be called in the characters of Schnitzler. But the resignation in which he finds his only antidote, and which seems to represent his nearest approach to a formulated philosophy, cannot be expected to satisfy us. One of his own countrymen, Hermann Bahr, has protested sharply against its insufficiency as a soul-sustaining faith, and in that protest I feel inclined to concur.
</p>
<p>
With "The Lonely Way" begins a series of plays representing not only Schnitzler's highest achievements so far, but a new note in the modern drama. To a greater extent than any other modern plays&#8212;not even excepting those of Ibsen&#8212;they must be defined as psychological. The dramas of Strindberg come nearest in this respect, but they, too, lag behind in soul-revealing quality. Plots are almost lacking in the Schnitzler productions during his later period. Things happen, to be sure, and these happenings are violent enough at times, but they do not constitute a sharply selected sequence of events leading up to a desired and foreshadowed end. In the further development of this period, even clearly defined themes are lost sight of, and the course of the play takes on an almost accidental aspect. This is puzzling, of course, and it must be especially provoking to those who expect each piece of art to have its narrow little lesson neatly tacked on in a spot where it cannot be missed. It implies a manner that exacts more alertness and greater insight on the part of the reader. But for that very reason these later plays of Schnitzler should prove stimulating to those who do not suffer from mental laziness or exhaustion.
</p>
<p>
"Intermezzo" (<i>Zwischenspiel</i>) might be interpreted as an attack on those new marital conventions which abolish the old-fashioned demand for mutual faithfulness and substitute mutual frankness. It would be more correct, however, to characterize it as a discussion of what constitutes true honesty in the ever delicate relationship between husband and wife. It shows, too, the growth of a woman's soul, once she has been forced to stand on her own feet. Viewed from this point, the play might very well be classified as feministic. It would be easy, for one thing, to read into it a plea for a single moral standard. But its ultimate bearing goes far beyond such a narrow construction. Here as elsewhere, Schnitzler shows himself more sympathetic toward the female than toward the male outlook on life, and the creator of
<i>
Cecilia Adams-Ortenburg
</i>
may well be proclaimed one of the foremost living painters of the woman soul.
</p>
<p>
The man who, in "Anatol," saw nothing but a rather weak-minded restlessness in woman's inconstancy, recognizes in "Intermezzo" woman's right to as complete a knowledge of life and its possibilities as any man may acquire. The same note is struck by
<i>
Johanna
</i>
in "The Lonely Way." "I want a time to come when I must shudder at myself&#8212;shudder as deeply as you can only when nothing has been left untried," she says to
<i>
Sala
</i>
in the fourth act. This note sounds much more clearly&#8212;one might say defiantly&#8212;through the last two acts of "Intermezzo." And when
<i>
Amadeus</i>, shrinking from its implications, cries to
<i>
Cecilia
</i>
that thereafter she will be guarded by his tenderness, she retorts impatiently: "But I don't want to be guarded! I shall no longer permit you to guard me!" In strict keeping with it is also that Schnitzler here realizes and accepts woman's capacity for and right to creative expression. It is from
<i>
Cecilia's
</i>
lips that the suggestion comes to seek a remedy for life's hurts in a passionate abandonment to work. In fact, the established attitudes of man and woman seem almost reversed in the cases of
<i>
Amadeus
</i>
and
<i>
Cecilia.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Significant as this play is from any point viewed, I am inclined to treasure it most on account of the subtlety and delicacy of its dialogue. I don't think any dramatist of modern times has surpassed Schnitzler in his ability to find expression for the most refined nuances of thought and feeling. To me, at least, it is a constant joy to watch the iridescence of his sentences, which gives to each of them not merely one, but innumerable meanings. And through so much of this particular play runs a spirit that can only be called playful&#8212;a spirit which finds its most typical expression in the delightful figure of
<i>
Albert Rhon</i>, the poet who takes the place of the otherwise inevitable physician. I like to think of that figure as more or less embodying the author's conception of himself. All the wit and sparkle with which we commonly credit the Gallic mind seems to me abundantly present in the scenes between
<i>
Albert
</i>
and
<i>
Amadeus</i>.
</p>
<p>
The poise and quiet characterizing "The Lonely Way" and "Intermezzo" appear lost to some extent in "The Call of Life" (<i>Der Ruf des Leben</i>), which, on the other hand, is one of the intensest plays written by Schnitzler. The white heat of its passion sears the mind at times, so that the reader feels like raising a shield between himself and the words. "It was as if I heard life itself calling to me outside my door,"
<i>
Marie
</i>
says in this play when trying to explain to
<i>
Dr. Schindler
</i>
why she had killed her father and gone to seek her lover. The play might as well have been named "The Will to Live," provided we remember that mere existence can hardly be called life. Its basic thought has much in common with that of Frank Wedekind's "Earth Spirit," but Schnitzler spiritualizes what the German playwright has vulgarized. There is a lot of modern heresy in that thought&#8212;a lot of revived and refined paganism that stands in sharp opposition to the spirit of Christianity as it has been interpreted hitherto. It might be summarized as a twentieth century version of Achilles' declaration that he would rather be a live dog than the ruler of all the shades in Hades. "What a creature can I be," cries
<i>
Marie</i>, "to emerge out of such an experience as out of a bad dream&#8212;awake&#8212;and living&#8212;and wanting to live?" And the kind, wise, Schnitzlerian doctor's answer is: "You are alive&#8212;and the rest
<i>
has been</i>...." Life itself is its own warrant and explanation. Unimpaired life&#8212;life with the power and will to go on living&#8212;is the greatest boon and best remedy of any that can be offered.
</p>
<p>
The weak point of "The Call to Life" is
<i>
Marie's
</i>
father, the old
<i>
Moser</i>&#8212;one of the most repulsive figures ever seen on the stage. It may have been made what it is in order that the girl's crime might not hopelessly prejudice the spectator at the start and thus render all the rest of the play futile. We must remember, too, that the monstrous egoism of
<i>
Moser
</i>
is not represented as a typical quality of that old age which feels itself robbed by the advance of triumphant youth. What Schnitzler shows is that egoism grows more repulsive as increasing age makes it less warranted. The middle act of the play, with its remarkable conversation between the
<i>
Colonel
</i>
and
<i>
Max</i>, brings us back to "Outside the Game Laws." That earlier play was in its time declared the best existing stage presentation of the spirit engendered by the military life. But it has a close second in "The Call of Life." To anyone having watched the manners of militarism in Europe, the words of the
<i>
Colonel
</i>
to
<i>
Max
</i>
will sound as an all-sufficient explanation: "No physicians have to spend thirty years at the side of beds containing puppets instead of human patients&#8212;no lawyers have to practice on criminals made out of pasteboard&#8212;and even the ministers are not infrequently preaching to people who actually believe in heaven and hell."
</p>
<p>
If "The Lonely Way" be Schnitzler's greatest play all around, and "Intermezzo" his subtlest, "Countess Mizzie" is the sweetest, the best tempered, the one that leaves the most agreeable taste in the mouth. It gives us a concrete embodiment of the tolerance toward all life that is merely suggested by the closing sentences of
<i>
Dr. Schindler
</i>
in the last act of "The Call of Life." It brings back the gay spirit of "Anatol," but with a rare maturity supporting it. The simple socio-biological philosophy of "Change Partners!" is restated without the needless naturalism of those early dialogues. The idea of "Countess Mizzie" is that, if we look deep enough, all social distinctions are lost in a universal human kinship. On the surface we appear like flowers neatly arranged in a bed, each kind in its separate and carefully labeled corner. Then Schnitzler begins to scrape off the screening earth, and underneath we find the roots of all those flowers intertwined and matted, so that it is impossible to tell which belong to the
<i>
Count
</i>
and which to
<i>
Wasner</i>, the coachman, which to
<i>
Miss Lolo</i>, the ballet-dancer, and which to the
<i>
Countess</i>.
</p>
<p>
"Young Medardus" is Schnitzler's most ambitious attempt at historical playwriting. It seems to indicate that he belongs too wholly in the present age to succeed in that direction. The play takes us back to 1809, when Napoleon appeared a second time outside the gates of Vienna. The central character,
<i>
Medardus Kl&#228;hr</i>, is said to be historical. The re-created atmosphere of old Vienna is at once convincing and amusing. But the play is too sprawling, too scattered, to get firm hold on the reader. There are seventy-four specifically indicated characters, not to mention groups of dumb figures. And while the title page speaks of five acts and a prologue, there are in reality seventeen distinct scenes. Each scene may be dramatically valuable, but the constant passage from place to place, from one set of characters to another, has a confusing effect.
</p>
<p>
There is, too, a more deep-lying reason for the failure of the play as a whole, I think. The ironical outlook so dear to Schnitzler&#8212;or rather, so inseparable from his temperament&#8212;has betrayed him. Irony seems hopelessly out of place in a historical drama, where it tends to make us feel that the author does not believe in the actual existence of his own characters. I have a suspicion that "Young Medardus" takes the place within the production of Schnitzler that is held by "Peer Gynt" in the production of Ibsen&#8212;that
<i>
Medardus Kl&#228;hr
</i>
is meant to satirize the Viennese character as
<i>
Peer Gynt
</i>
satirizes the Norwegian.
</p>
<p>
The keynote of the play may be found in the words of
<i>
Etzelt</i>, spoken as
<i>
Medardus
</i>
is about to be shot, after having refused to save his own life by a promise not to make any attempts against Napoleon's: "God wanted to make a hero of him, and the course of events turned him into a fool." The obvious interpretation is that the pettiness of Viennese conditions defeated the larger aspirations of the man, who would have proved true to his own possibilities in other surroundings. A more careful analysis of the plot shows, however, that what turns the ambitions of
<i>
Medardus
</i>
into dreams and words is his susceptibility to the charms of a woman. Once within the magic circle of her power, everything else&#8212;the danger of his country, the death of his sister, his duty to avenge the death of his father&#8212;becomes secondary to his passion. And each time he tries to rise above that passion, the reappearance of the woman is sufficient to deflect him from his purpose. It is as if Schnitzler wanted to suggest that the greatest weakness of the Viennese character lies in its sensuous concern with sex to the detriment of all other vital interests. To me it is a very remarkable thing to think that such a play was performed a large number of times at one of the foremost theaters in Vienna, and that, apparently, it received a very respectful hearing. I cannot but wonder what would happen here, if a play were put on the stage dealing in a similar spirit with the American character.
</p>
<p>
"The soul is a vast country, where many different things find place side by side," says Dr. Theodor Reik in his interesting volume named "Arthur Schnitzler als Psycholog" (Minden, 1913). Thus he explains the meaning of the title given to "The Vast Country" (<i>Das Weite Land</i>). And I don't think it is possible to get closer than that. Nowhere has Schnitzler been more casual in his use of what is commonly called plot. Nowhere has he scorned more completely to build his work around any particular "red thread." Event follows event with seeming haphazardness. The only thing that keeps the play from falling apart is the logical development of each character. It is, in fact, principally, if not exclusively, a series of soul-studies. What happens serves merely as an excuse to reveal the reaction of a certain character to certain external pressures or internal promptings. But viewed in this light, the play has tremendous power and significance.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Reik's book, to which I just referred, has been written to prove the direct connection between Schnitzler's art and the new psychology established by Dr. Sigmund Freud of Vienna. That the playwright must have studied the Freudian theories seems more than probable. That they may have influenced him seems also probable. And that this influence may have helped him to a clearer grasp of more than one mystery within the human soul, I am willing to grant also. What I want to protest against, is the attempt to make him out an exponent of any particular scientific theory. He is an observer of all life. He is what
<i>
Amadeus
</i>
in "Intermezzo" ironically charges
<i>
Albert Rhon
</i>
with being: "a student of the human soul." And he has undoubtedly availed himself of every new aid that might be offered for the analysis and interpretation of that soul. The importance of man's sub-conscious life seems to have been clear to him in the early days of "Anatol," and it seems to have grown on him as he matured. Another Freudian conception he has also made his own&#8212;that of the close connection between man's sexual life and vital phenomena not clearly designed for the expression of that life. But&#8212;to return to the point I have already tried to make&#8212;it would be dangerous and unjust to read any work of his as the dramatic effort of a scientific theorizer.
</p>
<p>
Schnitzler is of Jewish race. In Vienna that means a great deal more than in London, Stockholm or New York. It means an atmosphere of contempt, of suspicion, of hatred. It means frequently complete isolation, and always some isolation. It means a constant sense of conflict between oneself and one's surroundings. All these things are reflected in the works of Schnitzler&#8212;more particularly the sense of conflict and of isolation. Life itself is blamed for it most of the time, however, and it is only once in a great while that the specific and localized cause is referred to&#8212;as in "Literature," for instance. And even when Schnitzler undertakes, as he has done in his latest play, "Professor Bernhardi," to deal directly with the situation of the Jew within a community with strong anti-Semitic tendencies, he does not appear able to keep his mind fixed on that particular issue. He starts to discuss it, and does so with a clearness and fairness that have not been equaled since the days of Lessing&#8212;and then he drifts off in a new direction. The mutual opposition between Jews and Catholics becomes an opposition between the skeptical and the mystical temperaments. It is as if he wanted to say that all differences are unreal except those between individuals as such. And if that be his intention, he is right, I believe, and his play is the greater for bringing that thought home to us.
</p>
<p>
The play is a remarkable one in many respects. It deals largely with the internal affairs of a hospital. An overwhelming majority of the characters are physicians connected with the big hospital of which
<i>
Professor Bernhardi
</i>
is the head. They talk of nothing but what men of that profession in such a position would be likely to talk of. In other words, they are all the time "talking shop." This goes on through five acts. Throughout the entire play there is not the slightest suggestion of what the Broadway manager and the periodical editor call a "love interest." And yet the play holds you from beginning to end, and the dramatic tension could not be greater if its main theme were the unrequited love of the professor's son instead of his own right to place his duties as a physician above all other considerations. To one who has grown soul-weary of the "triangle" and all other combinations for the exploiting of illicit or legitimized love, "Professor Bernhardi" should come as a great relief and a bright promise.
</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>
These are the main outlines of Schnitzler's work as a dramatist. They indicate a constant, steady growth, coupled with increased realization of his own possibilities and powers as well as of his limitations. In all but a very few of his plays, he has confined himself to the life immediately surrounding him&#8212;to the life of the Viennese middle class, and more particularly of the professional element to which he himself belongs. But on the basis of a wonderfully faithful portrayal of local characters and conditions, he has managed to rear a superstructure of emotional appeal and intellectual clarification that must render his work welcome to thinking men and women wherever it be introduced. And as he is still in the flower of his manhood, it seems reasonable to expect that still greater things may be forthcoming from his pen.

The figures without brackets indicate the dates of production as given in the collected edition of Arthur Schnitzler's works issued by the
<i>
S. Fischer Verlag</i>, Berlin, 1912. The figures within brackets, showing the dates of publication, are taken from the twenty-fifth anniversary catalogue of the same house (Berlin, 1911), and from C. G. Kayser's "<i>Vollst&#228;ndiges B&#252;cher-Lexikon</i>" (Leipzig, 1891-1912).
</p>
<p>
"Anatol" was first published by the
<i>
Bibliographische Bureau
</i>
(Berlin, 1893), and "A Piece of Fiction" by E. Pierson (Dresden, 1894). Both were reprinted by the
<i>
Fischer Verlag
</i>
in 1895. The original versions of "A Piece of Fiction" and "Amours" have been considerably revised. "Change Partners!" was printed privately in 1900, and was subsequently published by the
<i>
Wiener Verlag</i>, Vienna. "The Gallant Kassian" was published by Ludwig Doblinger, Leipzig.
</p>
<p>
"The Green Cockatoo," "Paracelsus" and "The Life Partner" appeared in one volume with the sub-title "Three One-act Plays." "Hours of Life," "The Lady With the Dagger," "End of the Carnival," and "Literature" were published together under the title of the first play. "The Puppet Player," "The Gallant Cassian," and "The Greatest Show of All" were brought out in a single volume under the title of "Puppets" (<i>Marionetten</i>).
</p>
<p>
For additional bibliographical data, see "Arthur Schnitzler: a Bibliography," by Archibald Henderson (<i>Bulletin of Bibliography</i>, Boston, 1913); "The Modern Drama," by Ludwig Lewisohn (New York, 1915), and "The Continental Drama of Today," by Barrett H. Clark (New York, 1914). A good, though brief, analysis of Schnitzler's work is found in Dr. Lewisohn's volume.

Single scenes from "Anatol" were given at Ischl in the Summer of 1893, and at a matin&#233;e arranged by the journalistic society "Concordia" at one of the Vienna theaters in 1909. A Czechic translation of the whole series was staged at Smichow, Bohemia, sometime during the nineties. Three of the dialogues in "Change Partners!" were performed by members of the
<i>
Akademisch-dramatischer Verein
</i>
at Munich in 1904.
</p>
<p>
The official records of the Burgtheater at Vienna show that, up to the end of 1912, the eight Schnitzler plays forming part of its repertory had been performed the following number of times: "Paracelsus," 12; "Amours," 42; "The Legacy," 11; "The Life Partner," 14; "The Green Cockatoo," 8; "Intermezzo," 22; "Young Medardus," 43; "The Vast Country," 30.
</p>
<p>
The list of dates given above has been drawn chiefly from "Das moderne Drama," by Robert F. Arnold (Strassburg, 1912); "Das Burgtheater: statistische R&#252;ckblick," by Otto Rub (Vienna, 1913), and the current files of
<i>
B&#252;hne und Welt
</i>
(Berlin). For dates of Schnitzler performances in America and England, see the Henderson bibliography previously mentioned.

THE FIRST ACT
</p>
<p>
<i>
The little garden attached to Professor Wegrat's house. It is almost surrounded by buildings, so that no outlook of any kind is to be had. At the right in the garden stands the small two-storied house with its woodwork veranda, to which lead three wooden steps. Entries are made from the veranda as well as from either side of the house. Near the middle of the stage is a green garden table with chairs to match, and also a more comfortable armchair. A small iron bench is placed against a tree at the left.

</p>
<p>

Johanna is walking back and forth in the garden when Felix enters, wearing the uniform of a uhlan.
</i>
</p>
<br>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>turning about</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Felix!
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, it's me.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
How are you?&#8212;And how have you been able to get another furlough?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, it won't last long.&#8212;And how's mamma?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Doing pretty well the last few days.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Do you think she would be scared if I dropped in on her unexpectedly?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
No. But wait a little just the same. She's asleep now. I have just come from her room.&#8212;How long are you going to stay, Felix?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
To-morrow night I'm off again.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>staring into a fancied distance</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Off....
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, it sounds big! But one doesn't get so very far off&#8212;not in any respect.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And you have wanted it so badly.... (<i>Pointing to his uniform</i>) Now you've got it. And are you not satisfied?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, at any rate it is the most sensible thing I have gone into so far. For now I feel at least that I might achieve something under certain circumstances.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I believe you would make good in any profession.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I have my doubts whether I could get anywhere as a lawyer or an engineer. And on the whole I feel a good deal better than ever before. Often it seems to me as if I hadn't been born at the right time. I think I should have come into the world while there was still so much of order left in it, that one could venture all sorts of things one couldn't possibly venture nowadays.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, but you are free&#8212;you've got place to move.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Only within certain limits.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
They are a great deal wider than these at any rate.
</p>
<p>
FELIX (<i>looking around with a smile</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, this is not a prison.... Really, the garden has turned out quite pretty. How bare it looked when we were children.&#8212;What's that? A row of peach trees? That doesn't look bad at all.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
One of Dr. Reumann's ideas.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, I should have guessed it.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Because I can't believe any member of our family capable of such a useful inspiration. What are his chances anyhow?&#8212;I mean in regard to that professorship at Gratz?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I don't know anything about it. (<i>She turns away</i>)
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I suppose mamma is outdoors a good deal these fine days?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Are you still reading to her? Do you try to divert her a little? To cheer her up?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Just as if it were such an easy thing!
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
But you have to put some spunk into it, Johanna.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, Felix, it's easy for you to talk.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
What do you mean?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>speaking as if to herself</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
I don't know if you'll be able to understand me.
</p>
<p>
FELIX (<i>smiling</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why should it all at once be so hard for me to understand you?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>looking calmly at him</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Now when she is sick, I don't love her as much as before.
</p>
<p>
FELIX (<i>startled</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
What?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, it's impossible that you could quite understand. All the time she is getting farther away from us.... It is as if every day a new set of veils dropped down about her.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
And what is the meaning of it?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>continues to look at him in the same calm way</i>)
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
You think...?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
You know, Felix, that I never make any mistakes in things of that kind.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I
<i>
know</i>, you say...?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
When poor little Lillie von Sala had to die, I was aware of it in advance&#8212;before the rest of you knew that she was sick even.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, you had had a dream&#8212;and you were nothing but a child.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I didn't dream it. I knew it. (<i>Brusquely</i>) It's something I can't explain.
</p>
<p>
FELIX (<i>after a pause</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
And papa&#8212;has he resigned himself to it?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Resigned himself?&#8212;Do you think he too can see those veils coming down?
</p>
<p>
FELIX (<i>having first shaken his head slightly</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Nothing but imagination, Johanna&#8212;I am sure.&#8212;But now I want to.... (<i>Turning toward the house</i>) Papa hasn't come home yet?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
No. As a rule he's very late these days. He has an awful lot to do in the Academy.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I'll try not to wake her up&#8212;I'll be careful. (<i>He goes out by way of the veranda</i>)
</p>
<p class="dir">
[<i>While alone for a while, Johanna seats herself on the garden bench with her hands clasped across her knees. Sala enters. He is forty-five, but looks younger. Slender to the verge of leanness, and smooth-shaven. His brown hair, which has begun to turn gray at the temples, and which he wears rather long, is parted on the right side. His features are keen and energetic; his eyes, gray and clear.
</i>
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Good evening, Miss Johanna.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Good evening, Mr. von Sala.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
They told me your mother was having a little nap, and so I permitted myself to come out here in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Felix just got here.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well? Have they already granted him another furlough? In my days they were stricter in that regiment. However, we were then stationed near the border&#8212;somewhere in Galicia.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I can never keep in mind that you have gone through that kind of thing too.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, it's long ago now. And it didn't last more than a couple of years. But it was good fun as I look back at it now.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Like almost everything else you have experienced.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Like much of it.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Won't you sit down?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Thank you. (<i>He seats himself on the support of the armchair</i>) Am I permitted? (<i>Johanna having nodded assent, he takes a cigarette from his case and lights it</i>)
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Are you already settled in your new place, Mr. von Sala?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I move in to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And it gives you a great deal of pleasure, doesn't it?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
That would be a little premature.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Are you superstitious?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, for that matter&#8212;yes.&#8212;But that was not what I had in mind. I only take possession temporarily, not for good.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why not?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I'm going abroad&#8212;for a prolonged stay.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh? You are to be envied. I wish I could do the same&#8212;go here and there in the world, and not bother myself about a single human being.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Still at it?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Still at it.... What do you mean?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I recall how the same kind of schemes for traveling used to occupy your mind when you were nothing but a little girl. What was it you wanted to become?&#8212;A ballet dancer, I think. Wasn't that it? A very famous one, of course.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why do you say that as if it were nothing at all to be a ballet dancer? (<i>Without looking at him</i>) You, in particular, Mr. von Sala, should not be talking like that.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why not I, in particular?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>glances up calmly at him</i>)
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I don't quite make out what you mean, Miss Johanna.... Unless I must.... (<i>Simply</i>) Johanna, did you know at the time that I was looking at you?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
When?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Last year, when you were in the country, and I came out once and stayed over night in your attic. It was bright moonlight, and I thought I could see a fairy gliding back and forth in the meadow.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>nods with a smile</i>)
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And it was for me?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I saw you very well, where you stood behind the curtain.
</p>
<p>
SALA (<i>after a brief pause</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
I suppose you will never dance like that for other people?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why not?&#8212;I have already. And then, too, you were looking on. Of course, it was a good while ago.&#8212;It happened on one of the Greek islands. A large number of men stood in a circle around me ... you were one of them ... and I was a slave girl from Lydia.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
A princess in captivity.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>earnestly</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Don't you believe in such things?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
If you want me to&#8212;certainly.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>still very serious</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
You should believe everything in which the rest cannot believe.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
When the time comes for it, I suppose I shall.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
You see&#8212;I can rather believe anything than that I should now be in the world for the first time. And there are moments when I recall quite clearly all sorts of things.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And at that time you had such a moment?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, a year ago, when I was dancing for you in the meadow that moonlit summer night. I am sure it was not the first time, Mr. von Sala. (<i>After a short pause, with a sudden change of tone</i>) Where are you going anyhow?
</p>
<p>
SALA (<i>falling into the same tone</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
To Bactria, Miss Johanna.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Where?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
To Bactria. That's quite a remarkable country, and what's most remarkable about it is that it doesn't exist any longer. What it means is that I am joining an expedition which will start next November. You have read of it in the papers, haven't you?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
No.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
The proposition is to make excavations where it is supposed the ancient Ecbatana stood once&#8212;some six thousand years ago. That goes even farther back than your Lydian period, you see.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
When did you get hold of this idea?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Only a few days ago. Conversationally, so to speak. Count Ronsky, who is at the head of the matter, inspired me with a great desire to go. That wasn't very hard, however. He stirred an old longing within me. (<i>With more spirit</i>) Think of it, Miss Johanna: to be watching with your own eyes the gradual rising of such a buried city out of the ground&#8212;house by house, stone by stone, century by century. No, it wasn't meant that I should pass away until I had had this wish of mine fulfilled.
</p>

Why talk of dying then?

Is there ever a blissful moment in any decent man's life when he can think of anything else in his innermost soul?

I don't suppose a single wish of yours was ever left unfulfilled.
</p>
<p>

Not a single one...?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I know that you have also had many sad experiences. But frequently I believe you have longed for those too.

Longed for them...? You may be right, perhaps, in saying that I enjoyed them when they came.
</p>

How perfectly I understand that! A life without sorrow would probably be as bare as a life without happiness. (<i>Pause</i>) How long ago is it now?

What are you thinking of?

That Mrs. von Sala died?

<p>
SALA

<p class="indent">
It's seven years ago, almost to a day.

<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And Lillie&#8212;the same year?
</p>
<p>
SALA

<p class="indent">
Yes, Lillie died a month later. Do you often think of Lillie, Miss Johanna?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Quite often, Mr. von Sala. I have never had a girl friend since that time. (<i>As if to herself</i>) She too would have to be called "miss" now. She was very pretty. She had black hair with a bluish glint in it like your wife, and the same clear eyes that you have, Mr. von Sala. (<i>As if to herself</i>) "Then both of them walked hand in hand along the gloomy road that leads through sunlit land...."

What a memory you have, Johanna.

Seven years ago that was.... Remarkable!

<p class="indent">
Why remarkable?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA

<p class="indent">
You are building a house, and digging out submerged cities, and writing queer poetry&#8212;and human beings who once meant so much to you have been rotting in their graves these seven years&#8212;and you are still almost young. How incomprehensible the whole thing is!

"Thou that livest on, cease thou thy weeping," says Omar Nameh, who was born at Bagdad in the year 412 of the Mohammedan era as the son of a cobbler.

And recently, when the pitiful performance had come to an end and they were turning out the lights, he went right on, without apparent reason, and quite heedless of everything, playing away on that frightful old rattle-box of his. And then Ronsky and I asked him over to our table and had a chat with him. And then he told us that the piece he had just played was his own composition. Of course, we complimented him. And then his eyes lit up, and he asked us in a voice that shook: "Gentlemen, do you think my piece will make a hit?" He is thirty-eight years old, and his career has come to an end in a small restaurant where his public consists of nurse-girls and non-commissioned officers, and his one longing is&#8212;to get their applause!

Yes.

So another man has actually been called to Gratz?

No, not that way. But the other man, who was practically sure of the place, has broken his neck climbing a mountain.

I suppose my chances wouldn't be bad. But I have preferred to forgo them.

MRS. WEGRAT

How?

<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I won't accept the call.
</p>
<p>
MRS. WEGRAT

Is that out of superstition?
</p>
<p>
FELIX

Or out of pride?
</p>
<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Neither. But the thought of having another man's misfortune to thank for my own advancement would be extremely painful to me. Half my life would be spoiled for me. That is neither superstition nor pride, you see, but just commonplace, small-minded vanity.

You're a subtle one, Doctor.

Thank you. Does he still remember me?
</p>
<p>
FELIX

Not he alone. We are constantly being reminded of you&#8212;at every meal, in fact. Yours is among the pictures of former officers that hang in the mess rooms.

Good evening.&#8212;Why, Felix, are you here again? What a surprise!

Good evening, papa. I have applied for a two-day furlough.

WEGRAT

Furlough ... furlough? A real one? Or is it another one of those little brilliant tricks?

I am not in the habit of fibbing, papa, am I?

I meant no offense, my boy. Even if you had been guilty of deserting the flag, your longing to see your mother would be sufficient excuse for you.

To see his parents, you mean.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>

Of course&#8212;to see us all. But as you are a little under the weather, you come foremost just now.&#8212;Well, how are you getting along, Gabrielle? Better, are you not? (<i>In a low voice, almost timidly</i>) My love.... (<i>He strokes her brow and hair</i>) Love.... The air is so mild.

WEGRAT

Yes. Now, when I am also the president of it, there is a whole lot to do&#8212;and all of it is not pleasant or grateful. But I seem to be made for it, as they have insisted. And I suppose it will have to go on this way. (<i>With a smile</i>) As somebody once called me&#8212;an art-official.

Don't be so unjust to yourself, Professor.

I even went out of my way some distance&#8212;to pass across the old Turkish fort.<a href="#note1" name="noteref2"><sup><span class="small">2</span></sup>

I am awfully fond of that road. On evenings like this the whole city lies beneath you as if bathed in a silvery mist.&#8212;By the by, Gabrielle, I have some greetings to deliver. I met Irene Herms.
</p>
<p>
MRS. WEGRAT

Is she in Vienna?

Just passing through. She intends to call on you.

Has she still got an engagement at Hamburg?
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT

No, she has left the stage, she told me, and is now living in the country with her married sister.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I saw her once in a play of yours, Mr. von Sala.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Then you must have been a very small girl indeed.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
She played a Spanish princess.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Unfortunately. For princesses were not at all in her line. She has never in her life been able to treat verse properly.
</p>
<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And you can still bear that in mind, Mr. von Sala&#8212;that some lady on some occasion happened to handle your verse badly?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, why shouldn't I, my dear Doctor? If you were living at the center of the earth, you would know that all things are of equal weight. And were you floating in the center of the universe, you would suspect that all things are of equal importance.
</p>
<p>
MRS. WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
How does she look anyhow?
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
She is still very pretty.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Has she preserved her resemblance to that portrait of hers which is hanging in the Museum?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
What portrait is that?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Is her portrait really in the Museum?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, you know it. In the catalogue it is labeled "Actress"&#8212;just "Actress." A young woman in the costume of a harlequin, over which she has draped a Greek toga, while at her feet lie a confused heap of masks. With her staring glance turned toward the spectators, she stands there all alone on an empty, dusky stage, surrounded by odd pieces of misfit scenery&#8212;one wall of a room, a forest piece, part of an old dungeon....
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
And the background shows a southern landscape with palms and plane trees...?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, and it is partly raised so that still farther off you can see a pile of furniture, steps, goblets, chandeliers&#8212;all glittering in full daylight.
</p>
<p>
FELIX

But that's Julian Fichtner's picture?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Exactly.
</p>

FELIX

<p class="indent">
I had not the slightest idea that the figure of that woman was meant for Irene Herms.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Twenty-five years have passed since he painted that picture. It caused a tremendous sensation at the time. It was his first big success. And to-day I suppose there are lots of people who no longer remember his name.&#8212;Come to think of it, I asked Irene Herms about him. But strange to say, not even his "perennial best girl" could tell where in this world he happens to be straying.
</p>
<p>
FELIX

<p class="indent">
I talked with him only a few days ago.
</p>

What? You have seen Julian Fichtner? He was in Salzburg?&#8212;When?

He has turned rather gray, but otherwise he didn't seem to have changed at all.

Yes, now and then I have had a postcard from him.

So have we. But I thought you and he were corresponding regularly.

Regularly? Oh, no.

What do you mean by that, Mr. von Sala?

Oh, I can understand it. I suppose you have had the same experience with most people.

Something very much like it, at least.

Yes, one can see it from what you write, too.

I hope so. Otherwise it might just as well have been written by somebody else.

Did he say when he would be back in Vienna?

Soon, I think. But he didn't say very definitely.

What did it matter whether he was living here or elsewhere?&#8212;Even when he came to see us daily, it was always as if he had just arrived from some great distance.

<p>
WEGRAT

<p class="indent">
Oh, of course....

I had often the same feeling.

Well, it's strange how he has been knocking about in the world&#8212;these last few years at least.
</p>

Don't you think his restlessness goes farther back? Were you not students together in the Academy?
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes. And to know him properly, you must have known him then. There was something fascinating about him as a young man, something that dazzled. Never have I known anybody whom the term "of great promise" fitted so completely.

Well, he has kept a whole lot of it.

I believe that what you might achieve you do achieve.

WEGRAT

Not always. Julian was undoubtedly destined for higher things. What he lacked was the capacity for concentration, the inward calm. He could never feel at home for good anywhere. And the misfortune has been that in his own works, too, he has lived only as a transient, so to speak.

He showed me a couple of sketches he had made recently.

To me there was something gripping about them.

<p class="indent">
Why gripping? What kind of pictures were they?

<p>
FELIX

Landscapes. And as a rule very pleasant ones at that.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA

Once in a dream I saw a Spring landscape, very sunlit and soft, and yet it made me weep.

Yes, the sadness of certain things lies much deeper than we commonly suspect.

That's it, Mr. von Sala. That's where the great difference lies. In the case of an official you can feel perfectly safe on that score. (<i>With cheerful self-contempt</i>) Such a one paints every year his nice little picture for the exhibition, and couldn't possibly do anything else.

WEGRAT

Oh, I have not the least intention to play the modest one. But as to men of genius&#8212;we had better not talk of them at all. There you are dealing with a world by itself, lying outside of all discussion&#8212;as do the elements.

My opinion, I must confess, is utterly different.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT

Oh, it's of no use discussing anybody but those who have distinct limitations. And what I have found is&#8212;that he who knows his own limitations best is the better man. And on this point I have pretty good reason for self-respect.&#8212;Do you feel chilly, Gabrielle?

No.

And he looked him up.... It is perfectly clear that he went to Salzburg just to see him again. I suppose he is beginning to feel a little deserted.

REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why not pay a visit to a young friend when one happens to be near the place where he is living? I can see nothing peculiar in that.
</p>
<p>
MRS. WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Perhaps you are right. Perhaps I might have looked at the matter in the same way not long ago. But now, in the face of.... No, Doctor, I am not going to be sentimental.
</p>
<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I don't object to sentiment, but to nonsense.
</p>
<p>
MRS. WEGRAT (<i>smiling</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Thank you.&#8212;However, I have occasion to think of many different things. And it is no reason for taking it too seriously, my dear friend. You know, of course, that I told you everything merely that I might have a kind and sensible man with whom to discuss the past&#8212;and not at all to be absolved of any guilt.
</p>
<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
To give happiness is more than being free of guilt. And as this has been granted you, it is clear that you have made full atonement&#8212;if you'll pardon the use of such a preposterously extravagant term.
</p>
<p>
MRS. WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
How can you talk like that?
</p>
<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, am I not right?
</p>
<p>
MRS. WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Just as if I couldn't feel how all of us, deceivers and deceived, must seem equally contemptible to you in particular!
</p>
<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why to me in particular...? What you call contempt, madam&#8212;supposing I did feel anything like it&#8212;would, after all, be nothing but disguised envy. Or do you think I lack the desire to conduct my life as I see most other people conducting theirs? I simply haven't the knack. If I am to be frank, madam&#8212;the deepest yearning of all within me is just to be a rogue: a fellow who can dissemble, seduce, sneer, make his way over dead bodies. But thanks to a certain shortcoming in my temperament, I am condemned to remain a decent man&#8212;and what is still more painful perhaps: to hear everybody say that I am one.
</p>
<p>
MRS. WEGRAT (<i>who has been listening with a smile</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
I wonder whether you have told the truth about what is keeping you here in Vienna?
</p>
<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Certainly. Indeed, I have no other reason. I have no right to have any other. Don't let us talk any more of it.
</p>
<p>
MRS. WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Are we not such good friends that I can talk calmly with you of everything? I know what you have in mind. But I believe that it might be in your power to drive certain illusions and dreams out of the soul of a young girl. And it would be such a comfort to me if I could leave you for good among these people, all of whom are so near to me, and who yet know nothing whatever about each other&#8212;who are hardly aware of their mutual relationships even, and who seem fated to flitter away from each other to God knows where.
</p>
<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
We'll talk of those things, madam, when it's time to do so.
</p>
<p>
MRS. WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of course, I regret nothing. I believe I have never regretted anything. But I have a feeling that something is out of order. Perhaps it's nothing but that strange glimmer in the eyes of Felix which has caused all this unrest within me. But isn't it peculiar&#8212;uncanny almost&#8212;to think that a man like him may go through the world with all his senses open and yet never know whom he has to thank for being in the world?
</p>
<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Don't let us indulge in generalities, Mrs. Wegrat. In that way you can set the most solid things shaking and swaying until the steadiest eyes begin to grow dizzy. My own conclusion is this: that a lie which has proved strong enough to sustain the peace of a household can be no less respectable than a truth which could do nothing but destroy the image of the past, fill the present with sorrow, and confuse the vision of the future. (<i>He goes out with Mrs. Wegrat</i>)

JOHANNA (<i>entering with Sala</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
In this way one always gets back to the same spot. I suppose your garden is bigger, Mr. von Sala?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
My garden is the whole wide woods&#8212;that is, for people whose fancy is not restrained by a light fence.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Your villa has grown very pretty.

SALA

JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
A little while ago I saw it again for the first time in three years.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
But three years ago they hadn't put in the foundations yet.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
To me it was already standing there.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
How mysterious....
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Not at all. If you will only remember. Once we made an excursion to Dornbach<a href="#note3" name="noteref3"><sup><span class="small">3</span></sup></a>&#8212;my parents, and Felix, and I. There we met you and Mr. Fichtner, and it happened on the very spot where your house was to be built. And now everything looks just as you described it to us then.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
But how did you happen to be in that vicinity?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Since mamma was taken sick I have often had to take my walks alone....
</p>
<p>
SALA

And when was it you passed by my house?

JOHANNA

Not long ago&#8212;to-day.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
To-day?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA

<p class="indent">
Yes. I went all around it.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh? All around it?&#8212;Did you also notice the little gate that leads directly into the woods?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes.&#8212;But from that spot the house is almost invisible. The leafage is very thick.&#8212;Where have you placed those busts of the Roman emperors?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
They stand on columns at the opening of an avenue of trees. Right by is a small marble bench, and in front of the bench a little pool has been made.

THE SECOND ACT
</p>
<p>
<i>
In the home of Julian Fichtner. A pleasant, rather distinguished room in a state of slight disorder. Books are piled on two chairs, while on another chair stands an open traveling bag. Julian is seated at a writing desk, from the drawers of which he is taking out papers. Some of these he destroys, while others are thrown into the waste-paper basket.

Mr. von Sala. (<i>He goes out</i>)

SALA (<i>enters. His custom to walk up and down while talking asserts itself strikingly during the following scene. Now and then he sits down for a moment, often only on the arm of a chair. At times he stops beside Julian, putting his hand on the latter's shoulder while speaking. Two or three times during the scene he puts his hand to the left side of his chest, in a manner suggesting discomfort of some kind. But this gesture is not sharply accentuated</i>)
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I am delighted. (<i>They shake hands</i>)
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
So you got back early this morning?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And mean to stay...?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Haven't decided yet. Things are a little upset, as you see. And I fear they'll never be quite in shape again. I intend to give up this place.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Too bad. I have become so accustomed to it. In what direction are you going to move?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
It's possible that I don't take any new quarters at all for a while, but just keep on moving about as I have been doing the last few years. I am even considering to have my things sold at auction.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's a thought which gets no sympathy from me.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Really, I haven't got much sympathy for it myself. But the material side of the question has to be considered a little, too. I have been spending too much these last years, and it has to be evened up somehow. Probably I'll settle down again later on. Sometime one must get back to peace and work, I suppose.&#8212;Well, how goes it with you? What are our friends and acquaintances doing?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
So you haven't seen anybody yet?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Not one. And you are the only one I have written about my being here.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And you have not yet called on the Wegrats?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
No. I even hesitate to go there.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
After a certain age it would perhaps be better never to put your foot in any place where your earlier years were spent. It is so rare to find things and people the same as when you left them. Isn't that so?&#8212;Mrs. Gabrielle is said to have changed considerably in the course of her sickness. That's what Felix told me at least. I should prefer not to see her again. Oh, you can understand that, Sala.
</p>
<p>
SALA (<i>rather surprised</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of course, I understand. How long is it you have had no news from Vienna?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I have constantly started ahead of my mail. Not a single letter has overtaken me during the last fortnight. (<i>Alarmed</i>) What has happened?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Mrs. Gabrielle died a week ago.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh! (<i>He is deeply moved; for a while he walks back and forth; then he resumes his seat and says after a pause</i>) Of course, it was to be expected, and yet....
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Her death came easily.... You know how those left behind always pretend to know such things with certainty. Anyhow, she fell asleep quietly one night and never woke up again.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN (<i>in low voice</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Poor Gabrielle!&#8212;Did you see anything of her toward the end?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, I went there almost daily.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, did you?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Johanna asked me. She was literally afraid of being alone with her mother.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Afraid?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
The sick woman inspired her with a sort of horror. She has calmed down a little now.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
What a strange creature.... And how does our friend, the professor, bear up under his loss? Resigned to the will of God, I suppose?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
My dear Julian, the man has a position. I fear we cannot grasp that, we who are Gods by the grace of the moment&#8212;and also less than men at times.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of course, Felix is not here?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I talked with him less than an hour ago, and informed him that you were here. It made him very happy to have you call on him in Salzburg.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
It looked so to me. And he did me a lot of good. For that matter, I have really thought of settling down in Salzburg.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
For ever?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
For a while. On account of Felix, too. His unspoiled nature affects me very pleasantly&#8212;it makes me actually feel younger. Were he not my son, I might almost envy him&#8212;and not on account of his youth alone. (<i>With a smile</i>) Thus there is nothing left for me but to love him. I must say that I feel a little ashamed at having to do it incognito, so to speak.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Are not these feelings a little belated in their appearance?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I suppose they were there long before I knew. And, you know, I saw the youngster for the first time when he was ten or eleven years old, and it was only then I learned that he was my son.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
It must have been a strange meeting between you and Mrs. Gabrielle, ten years after you had committed that piece of hideous perfidy&#8212;as our ancestors used to put it.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
It wasn't strange even. It came about quite naturally. Shortly after my return from Paris I happened to meet Wegrat on the street. Of course, we had heard of each other from time to time, and we met as old friends. There are people who seem born to a fate of that kind.... And as for Gabrielle....
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
She had forgiven you, of course?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Forgiven...? It was more or less than that. Only once did we talk of the past&#8212;she without reproach, and I without regret: as if the whole story had happened to somebody else. And after that never again. I might have thought some miracle had wiped those earlier days out of her memory. In fact, as far as I am concerned, there seemed to be no real connection between that quiet matron and the creature I had once loved. And as for the youngster&#8212;well, you know&#8212;at first I didn't care more for him than I might have cared for any other pretty and gifted child.&#8212;Of course, ten years ago my life had a different aspect. I was still clinging to so many things which since then have slipped away from me. It was only in the course of time that I became more and more drawn to the house, until at last I began to feel at home there.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I hope you never took offense at my gradual discovery of the true state of affairs.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
You, at any rate, didn't think me very sensible....
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why not? I too find that family life in itself is quite attractive. Only it ought, after all, to be experienced in one's own family.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
You know very well that I have frequently felt something like actual shame at the incongruity of that relationship. It was in fact one of the things that drove me away. Of course, there were a lot of other things that pressed on me at the time. Especially that I couldn't make a real success out of my work.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
But you hadn't been exhibiting anything for a long time.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
It wasn't external success I had in mind. I could never get into the right mood any more, and I hoped that traveling would help me again, as it had done so often in earlier years.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And how did you fare? We have heard so little of you here. You might really have written me a little more frequently and fully. For you know, of course, that I care a great deal more for you than for most other people. We have such a knack of giving each other the right cue&#8212;don't you think? There are sentimental people who speak of such a relation as friendship. And it is not impossible that we used to address each other by our Christian names some time during the last century, or that you may even have wept your fill on my shoulder. I have missed you more than once during these two years&#8212;honestly! On my lonely walks I have quite frequently thought of our pleasant chats in the Dornbach park, where we were in the habit of disposing temporarily of (<i>quoting</i>) "what is most lofty and profound in this our world."&#8212;Well, Julian, from where do you come anyhow?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
From the Tyrol? During the Summer I made long tours on foot. I have even turned mountain climber in my old days. I spent a whole week at one of those pasturing grounds in the Alps.... Yes, I have been up to all sorts of things. It's a wonder what you can do when you are all alone.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And you have really been all alone?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
All these last years?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
If I don't count a few nonsensical interruptions&#8212;yes.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
But there should have been no difficulty in that respect.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I know. But I cannot rest satisfied with what is still offered me of that kind of thing. I have been badly spoiled, Sala. Up to a certain period my life passed away in a constant orgy of tenderness and passion, and of power, you might say. And that is all over. Oh, Sala, what pitiful fictions I have had to steal, and beg, and buy, during these last years! It gives me nausea to look back at it, and it horrifies me to look ahead. And I ask myself: can there really be nothing left of all that glow with which I once embraced the world but a sort of silly wrath because it's all over&#8212;because I&#8212;<i>I</i>&#8212;am no less subject to human laws than anybody else?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why all this bitterness, Julian? There is still a great deal to be had out of this world, even when some of the pleasures and enjoyments of our earlier years have begun to appear tasteless or unseemly. And how can you, of all people, miss that feeling, Julian?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Snatch his part from an actor and ask him if he can still take pleasure in the beautiful scenery surrounding him.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
But you have begun to work again while you were traveling?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Hardly at all.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Felix told us that you had brought some sketches from your trunk in order to show him.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
He spoke of them?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, and nothing but good.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Really?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And as you showed those things to him, you must have thought rather well of them yourself.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
That was not the reason why I let him see them. (<i>Walking back and forth</i>) I must tell you&#8212;at the risk of having you think me a perfect fool.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, a little more or less won't count. Speak out.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I wanted him at least not to lose faith in me. Can you understand that? After all, he is nearer to me than the rest. Of course, I know&#8212;to everybody, even to you, I am one who has gone down, who is finished&#8212;one of those whose only talent was his youth. It doesn't bother me very much. But to Felix I want to be the man I was once&#8212;just as I still
<i>
am
</i>
that man. When he learns sometime that I am his father, he must be proud of it.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
When he learns it...?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I have no intention to keep it hidden from him forever. Now, when his mother is dead, less than ever. Last time I talked to him, it became clear to me, not only that it would be right, but that it would almost be a duty, to tell him the truth. He has a mind for essentials. He will understand everything. And I shall have a human being who belongs to me, who knows that he belongs to me, and for whose sake it is worth while to keep on living in this world. I shall live near him, and be with him a good deal. Once more I shall have my existence put on a solid basis, so to speak, and not hung in mid-air, as it is now. And then I shall be able to work again&#8212;work as I did once&#8212;as when I was a young man. Work, that is what I am going to do&#8212;and all of you will turn out to have been wrong&#8212;all of you!
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
But to whom has it occurred to doubt you? If you could only have heard us talk of you a little while ago, Julian. Everybody expects that, sooner or later, you&#8212;will find yourself again completely.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, that's enough about me, more than enough. Pardon me. Let us hear something about yourself at last. I suppose you have already moved into your new house?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And what plans have you for the immediate future?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I am thinking of going to Asia with Count Ronsky.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
With Ronsky? Are you going to join that expedition about which so much has been written?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes. Some such undertaking has been tempting me for a long time. Are you perhaps familiar with the Rolston report on the Bactrian and Median excavations of 1892?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
No.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, it is positively staggering. Think of it&#8212;they suspect that under the refuse and the dust lies a monster city, something like the present London in extent. At that time they made their way into a palace, where the most wonderful paintings were found. These were perfectly preserved in several rooms. And they dug out stairways&#8212;built of a marble that is nowhere to be found nowadays. Perhaps it was brought from some island which since then has sunk beneath the sea. Three hundred and twelve steps glittering like opals and leading down into unknown depths.... Unknown because they ceased digging after they had reached the three hundred and twelfth step&#8212;God only knows why! I don't think I can tell you how those steps pique my curiosity.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
But it has always been asserted that the Rolston expedition was lost?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, not quite as bad as that. Out of twenty-four Europeans, eight got back after three years in spite of all&#8212;and half a dozen of them had been lost before they ever got there. You have to pass through pretty bad fever belts. And at that time they had to face an attack of the Kurds, too, by which several were done for. But we shall be much better equipped. Furthermore, at the border we shall be joined by a Russian contingent which is traveling under military escort. And here, too, they think of putting a military aspect on the affair. As to the fever&#8212;that doesn't scare me&#8212;it can't do me any harm. As a young man I spent a number of particularly dangerous Summer nights in the
<i>
thermae
</i>
of Caracalla&#8212;you know, of course, what boggy ground that is&#8212;and remained well.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
But that doesn't prove anything.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh yes, a little. There I came across a Roman girl whose home was right by the Appian Way. She caught the fever and died from it.... To be sure, I am not as young as I was then, but so far I have been perfectly well.
</p>

JULIAN (<i>who has already smoked several cigarettes, offers one to Sala</i>) Don't you smoke?

<p>
SALA

<p class="indent">
Thanks. Really, I shouldn't. Only yesterday Dr. Reumann told me I mustn't.... Nothing particular&#8212;my heart is a little restless, that's all. Well, a single one won't do any harm, I suppose.

Miss Herms, sir. She's asking whether she can see you.

Certainly. Ask her to come in.

IRENE HERMS (<i>enters. She is about forty-three, but doesn't look it. Her dress is simple and in perfect taste. Her movements are vivacious, and at times almost youthful in their swiftness. Her hair is deeply blonde in color and very heavy. Her eyes are merry, good-humored most of the time, and easily filled with tears. She comes in with a smile and nods in a friendly manner to Sala. To Julian, who has gone to meet her, she holds out her hand with an expression on her face that is almost happy</i>) Good evening. Well? (<i>She has the habit of pronouncing that "well" in a tone of sympathetic inquiry</i>) So I did right after all in keeping my patience a couple of days more. Here I've got you back now. (<i>To Sala</i>) Can you guess the length of time we haven't seen each other?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
More than three years.
</p>
<p class="hang">
IRENE (<i>nods assent and permits him at last to withdraw his hand from hers</i>) In all our lives that has never happened before. And your last letter is already two months old. I call it "letter" just to save my face. But it was only a view-card. Where in the world have you been anyhow?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Sit down, won't you? I'll tell you all about it. Won't you take off your hat? You'll stay a while, I hope?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of course.&#8212;And the way you look! (<i>To Sala</i>) Fine, don't you think? I've always known that a gray beard would make him look awfully interesting.

Now you'll have nothing but pleasantries to listen to. Unfortunately I shall have to be moving.

I'm not going there now. I'm going home.

Home? And you say that in such a matter-of-fact way? I understand you are now living in a perfect palace.
</p>
<p>
SALA

<p class="indent">
No, anything but that. A modest country house. It would give me special pleasure, Miss Herms, if sometime you would make sure of it in person. My garden is really pretty.

Have you fruit trees, too, and vegetables?

Must you leave again so soon?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Certainly. I have to get home again. Only this morning I had a letter from my little nephew&#8212;and he's longing for me. A little rascal of five, and he, too, is longing already. What do you think of that?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And you are also longing to get back, I suppose?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
It isn't that. But I'm beginning to get accustomed to Vienna again. As I'm going about the streets here, I run across memories at every corner.&#8212;Can you guess where I was yesterday, Julian? In the rooms where I used to live as a child. It wasn't easy by any means, as a lot of strangers are living there now. But I got into the rooms just the same.
</p>
<p>
SALA (<i>with amicable irony</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
How did you manage it, Miss Herms?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I sneaked in under a pretext. I pretended to believe that there was a room to be let&#8212;for a single elderly lady. But at last I fell to weeping so that I could see the people thought me out of my mind. And then I told them the true reason for my coming there. A clerk in the post-office is living there now with his wife and two children. One of these was such a nice little chap. He was playing railroad with an engine that could be wound up, and that ran over one of my feet all the time.... But I can see that all this doesn't interest you very much, Mr. von Sala.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
How
<i>
can
</i>
you interrupt yourself like that, Miss Herms, just when it is most exciting? I should have loved to hear more about it. But now I must really go, unfortunately. Good-by, Julian.&#8212;Then, Miss Herms, I may count on a visit from you. (<i>He goes out</i>)

<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Thank God!
</p>
<p>
JULIAN (<i>smiling</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Do you still have the same antipathy for him?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Antipathy?&#8212;I hate him! Nothing but your incredible kindness of heart would let him come near you. For you have no worse enemy.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Where did you get that idea?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
My instinct tells me&#8212;you can feel such things.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I fear, however, that even now you cannot judge him quite objectively.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why not?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
You can't forgive him that you failed in one of his plays ten years ago.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Unfortunately it's already twelve years ago. And it wasn't my fault. For my opinion in regard to his so-called poetry is, that it's nonsense. And I am not the only one who thinks so, as you know. But you don't know him, of course. To appreciate that gentleman in all his glory, you must have enjoyed him at a rehearsal. (<i>Imitating Sala</i>) Oh, madam, that's verse&#8212;it's verse, dear madam.... Only when you have heard that kind of thing from him can you understand how limitless his arrogance is.... And everybody knows, by the way, that he killed his wife.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN (<i>amused</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
But, girl, who in the world put such horrible ideas into your head?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, people don't die willy-nilly like that, at twenty-five....
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I hope, Irene, that you don't talk like this to other people?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
What would be the use? Everyone knows it but you. And I for my part have no reason to spare Mr. von Sala, who for twenty years has pursued me with his jeers.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And yet you are going to call on him?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of course. Beautiful villas interest me very much. And they tell me his is ravishing. If you were only to see people who....
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Hadn't killed anybody....
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Really, we show him too much honor in talking so long about him. That ends it.&#8212;Well, Julian? How goes it? Why haven't you written me oftener? Is it possible you didn't dare?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Dare...?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Were you forbidden, I mean?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN

<p class="indent">
I see.&#8212;Nobody can forbid me anything.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Honestly? You live all by yourself?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I'm delighted. I can't help it, Julian, but I am delighted. Although it's sheer nonsense. This day, or the next, there'll be something new going on.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Those days are past.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
If it were only true!&#8212;Can I have a cup of tea?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Certainly. The samovar is right there.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Where?&#8212;Oh, over there. And the tea?&#8212;Oh, I know! (<i>She opens a small cupboard and brings out what she needs; during the next few minutes she is busy preparing the tea</i>)
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
So you are really going to stay here only a couple of days more?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of course. I have done all my ordering. You understand, in my sister's house out there one doesn't need to dress up.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Tell me about it. How do you like it out there?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Splendidly. Oh, it's bliss merely to hear nothing more about the theater.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And yet you'll return to it sometime.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's where you are completely mistaken. Why should I? You must remember that I have now reached the goal of all my desires: fresh air, and woods right by; horseback riding across meadows and fields; early morning seated in the big park, dressed in my kimono, and nobody daring to intrude. To put it plainly: no people, no manager, no public, no colleagues, no playwrights&#8212;though, of course, all are not as arrogant as your precious Sala.&#8212;Well, all this I have attained at last. I live in the country. I have a country house&#8212;almost a little palace, you might say. I have a park, and a horse, and a kimono&#8212;to use as much as I please. It isn't all mine, I admit&#8212;except the kimono, of course&#8212;but what does that matter? In the bargain, I live with the best people one could hope to find in this world. For my brother-in-law is, if possible, a finer fellow than Lora herself even.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Wasn't he rather making up to you once?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I should say he was! He wanted to marry me at any cost. Of course!&#8212;It was always in me that they were at first&#8212;I mean that they always
<i>
have been
</i>
in love with me. But as a rule the clever ones have gone over to Lora. In fact, I have always felt a little distrustful toward you because you never fell in love with Lora. And how much she is ahead of me&#8212;well,
<i>
you
</i>
know, and it's no use talking of it. What all don't I owe to Lora!... If it hadn't been for her...!&#8212;Well, it's with them I have been living the last half year.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
The question is only how long you are going to stand it.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
How long...? But, Julian, I must ask you what there could be to make me leave such a paradise and return to the morass where I (<i>in a lowered voice</i>) spent twenty-five years of my life. What could I possibly expect out of the theater anyhow? I am not made for elderly parts. The heroic mother, the shrewish dame and the funny old woman are equally little to my liking. I intend to die as "the young lady from the castle"&#8212;as an old maid, you might say&#8212;and if everything goes right, I shall appear to the grandchildren of my sister some hundred years from now as the Lady in White. In a word, I have the finest kind of a life ahead of me.&#8212;Why are you laughing?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
It pleases me to see you so jolly again&#8212;so youthful.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
It's the country air, Julian. You should try it yourself for a good long while. It's glorious! In fact, I think I have missed my true calling. I'm sure the good Lord meant me for a milkmaid or farm girl of some kind. Or perhaps for a young shepherd. I have always looked particularly well in pants.&#8212;There now. Do you want me to pour a cup for you at once? (<i>She pours the tea</i>) Have you nothing to go with it?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I think there must still be a few crackers left in my bag. (<i>He takes a small package out of his traveling bag</i>)
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Thanks. That's fine.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
This is quite a new fancy of yours, however.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Crackers...?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, nature.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
How can you say so? I have always had a boundless love for nature. Don't you recall the excursions we used to make? Don't you remember how once we fell asleep in the woods on a hot Summer afternoon? And don't you ever think of that shrine of the Holy Virgin, on the hill where we were caught by the storm?... Oh, mercy! Nature is no silly illusion. And still later&#8212;when I struck the bad days and wanted to kill myself for your sake, fool that I was ... then nature simply proved my salvation. Indeed, Julian! I could still show you the place where I threw myself on the grass and wept. You have to walk ten minutes from the station, through an avenue of acacias, and then on to the brook. Yes, I threw myself on the grass and wept and wailed. It was one of those days, you know, when you had again sent me packing from your door. Well, and then, when I had been lying half an hour in the grass, and had wept my fill, then I got up again&#8212;and began to scamper all over the meadow. Just like a kid, all by myself. Then I wiped my eyes and felt quite right again. (<i>Pause</i>) Of course, next morning I was at your door again, setting up a howl, and then the story began all over again.
</p>
<p class="dir">
[<i>It is growing dark.

</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why do you still think of all that?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
But you do it, too. And who has proved the more stupid of us two in the end? Who? Ask yourself, on your conscience. Who?... Have you been more happy with anybody else than with me? Has anybody else clung to you as I did? Has anybody else been so fond of you?... No, I am sure. And as to that foolish affair into which I stumbled during my engagement abroad&#8212;you might just as well have overlooked it. Really, there isn't as much to that kind of thing as you men want to make out&#8212;when it happens to one of us, that is to say. (<i>Both drink of their tea</i>)
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Should I get some light?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
It's quite cosy in the twilight like this.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
"Not much to it," you say. Perhaps you are right. But when it happens to anybody, he gets pretty mad as a rule. And if we had made up again&#8212;it would never have been as before. It's better as it is. When the worst was over, we became good friends once more, and so we have been ever since. And that is a pretty fine thing, too.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes. And nowadays I'm quite satisfied. But at that time...! Oh, mercy, what a time that was! But you don't know anything about it, of course. It was afterward I began really to love you&#8212;after I had lost you through my own thoughtlessness. It was only then I learned how to be faithful in the true sense. For anything that has happened to me since then.... But it's asking too much that a man should understand that kind of thing.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I understand quite well, Irene. You may be sure.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
And besides I want to tell you something: it was nothing but a well-deserved punishment for both of us.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
For both of us?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, that's what I have figured out long ago. A well-deserved punishment.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
For both of us?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, for you, too.

<p>
JULIAN

<p class="indent">
But what do you mean by that?

<p class="indent">
We had deserved no better.

<p>
JULIAN

<p class="indent">
We...? In what way?

<p>
IRENE (<i>very seriously</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
You are so very clever otherwise, Julian. Now what do you say&#8212;do you think it could have happened as it did&#8212;do you think I could have made a mistake like that&#8212;if we&#8212;had had a child? Ask yourself on your conscience, Julian&#8212;do you believe it? I don't, and you don't either. Everything would have happened in a different way. Everything. We had stayed together then. We had had
<i>
more
</i>
children. We had married. We might be living together now. I shouldn't have become an old-maidish "young lady from the castle," and you wouldn't have become....

<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
An old bachelor.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, if you say it yourself. And the main thing is this: we

a child. I had a child. (<i>Pause</i>)
</p>
<p>
JULIAN (<i>walking back and forth</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
What's the use, Irene? Why do you begin to talk of all those forgotten things again...?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Forgotten?

JULIAN

<p class="indent">
... Things gone by.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, they are bygone, of course. But out there in the country you have plenty of time. All sorts of things keep passing through your head. And especially when you see other people's children&#8212;Lora has two boys, you know&#8212;then you get all sorts of notions. It almost amounted to a vision not long ago.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
What?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
It was toward evening, and I had walked across the fields. I do it quite often, all by myself. Far and wide there was nobody to be seen. And the village down below was quite deserted, too. And I walked on and on, always in direction of the woods. And suddenly I was no longer alone. You were with me. And between us was the child. We were holding it by the hands&#8212;our little child. (<i>Angrily, to keep herself from crying</i>) It's too silly for anything! I know, of course, that our child would be a gawky youngster of twenty-three by now&#8212;that it might have turned into a scamp or a good-for-nothing girl. Or that it might be dead already. Or that it had drifted out into the wide world, so that we had nothing left of it&#8212;oh, yes, yes.... But we should have had it once, for all that&#8212;once there would have been a little child that seemed rather fond of us. And.... (<i>She is unable to go on; silence follows</i>)

You shouldn't talk yourself into such a state, Irene.

I am not talking myself into anything.

<p>
JULIAN

<p class="indent">
Don't brood. Accept things as they are. There have been other things in your life&#8212;better things, perhaps. Your life has been much richer than that of a mere mother could ever have been.... You have been an artist.

IRENE (<i>as if to herself</i>)

<p class="indent">
I don't care that much for it.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN

A great, famous one&#8212;that means something after all. And your life has brought you many other exquisite experiences&#8212;since the one with me. I am sure of it.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
What have I got left of it? What does it amount to? A woman who has no child has never been a woman. But a woman who once might have had one&#8212;who should have had one, and who&#8212;(<i>with a glance at him</i>)&#8212;has never become a mother, she is nothing but&#8212;oh! But that's what a man cannot understand! It is what not one of them can understand! In this respect the very best one of the lot will always remain something of a cad. Is there one of you who knows how many of his own offspring have been set adrift in the world? I know at least that there are none of mine. Can you say as much?

<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I have to be off again the day after to-morrow, and so I wasn't sure whether I could find any chance at all to see you.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Won't you take off your coat?&#8212;Think of it, I didn't have the slightest idea.... It was Sala who told me&#8212;less than an hour ago.

last summer.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Was it very sudden?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes. And I, who couldn't be with her.... Late that evening I had to leave, and she died during the night.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Say rather that she didn't wake up again next morning.
</p>
<p>
FELIX

We owe a lot of thanks to you, Miss Herms.

<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, please...!

FELIX

It always gave my mother so much pleasure to have you with her, chatting, or playing the piano to her.

JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
What's the hurry, Miss Herms?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I'm going to the opera. I have to make good use of the few days I shall still be here.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Shall we see you at our house again, Miss Herms?
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Certainly.&#8212;You'll have to leave before me, won't you?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, my furlough will be up....
</p>
<p>
IRENE (<i>as if en passant</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
How long have you been an officer anyhow, Felix?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
For three years really&#8212;but I didn't apply for a commission until this year&#8212;a little too late, perhaps.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Too late? Why?&#8212;How old are you, Felix?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Twenty-three.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh! (<i>Pause</i>) But when I saw you four years ago as a volunteer, I thought at once you would stay in the service.&#8212;Do you remember, Julian, I told you so at the time?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes....
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
That must have been in the summer, the last time you called on us.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I think so....
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Many things have changed since then.
</p>
<p>
IRENE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Indeed! Those were still happy days.&#8212;Don't you think so, Julian? For we haven't met either since we spent those beautiful summer evenings in the garden of the Wegrats.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN (<i>nods assent</i>)
</p>
<p class="hang">
IRENE (<i>stands again looking now at Julian and now at Felix; brief pause</i>) Oh, but now it's high time for me to be gone.&#8212;Good-by. Remember me at home, Lieutenant.&#8212;Good-by, Julian. (<i>She goes out, accompanied to the door by Julian</i>)
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Haven't you made some changes here?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Not to my knowledge. And how could you know anyhow? You have only been here two or three times.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes. But the last time at one of the most important moments in my life. I came here to get your advice.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, everything has turned out in accordance with your wish. Even your father has resigned himself to it.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, he has resigned himself. Of course, he would have preferred to see me continue my technical studies. But now he has seen that it is quite possible to lead a sensible life in uniform too&#8212;without any debts or duels. In fact, my life is almost too smooth. However, there is at least more to anticipate for one of us than for most people. And that's always something.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And how are things at home?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
At home.... Really, it's almost as if that word had lost its meaning.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Has your father resumed his duties again?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of course. Two days later he was back in his studio. He is wonderful. But I can't quite understand it.... Am I disturbing you, Mr. Fichtner? You were putting your papers in order, I think.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, there's no hurry about that. They're easily put in order. Most of them I burn.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
It's more sensible, don't you think, to destroy things one hardly cares to look at any more?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
But doesn't it make you rather sad to clean out your past like that?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Sad?... No, it's entirely too natural a process for that.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I can't see it that way. Look here. To burn a letter, or a picture, or something of that kind, immediately after you have got it&#8212;that seems quite natural to me. But something at all worthy of being kept as a remembrance of some poignant joy or equally poignant sorrow would seem incapable of ever losing its significance again. And especially in the case of a life like yours, that has been so rich and so active.... It would seem to me that at times you must feel something like&#8212;awe in the face of your own past.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Where do you get such thoughts&#8212;you, who are so young?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
They just came into my head this minute.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
You are not so very much mistaken, perhaps. But there is something else besides, that makes me want to clean house. I am about to become homeless, so to speak.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I'm giving up my rooms here, and don't know yet what my next step will be. And so I think it's more pleasant to let these things come to a decent end rather than to put them in a box and leave them to molder away in a cellar.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
But don't you feel sorry about a lot of it?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I don't know.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
And then you must have mementoes that mean something to other people besides yourself. Sketches of all kinds, for instance, which I think you have saved to some extent.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Are you thinking of those little things I showed you in Salzburg?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, of those too, of course.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
They are still wrapped up. Would you like to have them?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Indeed, I should feel very thankful. They seemed to have a particular charm for me. (<i>Pause</i>) But there's something else I wanted to ask of you. A great favor. If you will let me....
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Tell me, please.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I thought you might still have left a picture of my mother as a young girl. A small picture in water colors painted by yourself.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, I did paint such a picture.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
And you have still got it?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I guess it can be found.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I should like to see it.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Did your mother remember this picture...?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, she mentioned it to me the last evening I ever saw her&#8212;the evening before she died. At the time I didn't imagine, of course, that the end was so near&#8212;and I don't think she could guess it either. To-day it seems rather peculiar to me that, on that very evening, she had to talk so much of days long gone by.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And of this little picture, too?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
It's a very good one, I understand.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN (<i>as if trying to remember</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Where did I put it? Wait now.... (<i>He goes to a book case, the lower part of which has solid doors; these he opens, disclosing several shelves piled with portfolios</i>) I painted it in the country&#8212;in the little house where your grandparents used to live.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I know.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
You can hardly recall the old people, I suppose?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Very vaguely. They were quite humble people, were they not?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes. (<i>He has taken a big portfolio from one of the shelves</i>) It ought to be in this portfolio. (<i>He puts it on the writing desk and opens it; then he sits down in front of it</i>)
</p>
<p>
FELIX (<i>stands behind him, looking over his shoulder</i>)
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Here is the house in which they lived&#8212;your grandparents and your mother. (<i>He goes through the sketches, one by one</i>) And here is a view of the valley seen from the cemetery.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
In Summer....
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes.&#8212;And here is the little inn at which your father and I used to stop.... And here.... (<i>He looks in silence at the sketch; both remain silent for a long while</i>)
</p>
<p>
FELIX (<i>picking up the sketch</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
How old was my mother at the time?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN (<i>who remains seated</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Eighteen.
</p>
<p class="hang">
FELIX (<i>going a few steps away and leaning against the bookcase in order to get better light on the picture</i>)
</p>
<p class="dir">
A year before she was married, then.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
It was done that very year. (<i>Pause</i>)
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
What a strange look that meets me out of those eyes.... There's a smile on her lips.... It's almost as if she were talking to me....
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
What was it your mother told you&#8212;that last evening?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Not very much. But I feel as if I knew more than she had told me. What a queer thought it is, that as she is now looking at me out of this picture, so she must have been looking at you once. It seems as if there was a certain timidity in that look. Something like fear almost.... In such a way you look at people out of another world, for which you long, and of which you are afraid nevertheless.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
At that time your mother had rarely been outside the village.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
She must have been different from all other women you have met, wasn't she?&#8212;Why don't you say anything? I am not one of those men who cannot understand&#8212;who won't understand that their mothers and sisters are women after all. I can easily understand that it must have been a dangerous time for her&#8212;and for somebody else as well. (<i>Very simply</i>) You must have loved my mother very much?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
You have a curious way of asking questions.&#8212;Yes, I did love her.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
And those moments must have been very happy ones, when you sat in that little garden with its overgrown fence, holding this canvas on your knees, and out there on the bright meadow, among all those red and white flowers, stood this young girl with anxiously smiling eyes, holding her straw hat in one hand.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Your mother talked of those moments that last evening?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes.&#8212;It is childish perhaps, but since then it has seemed impossible to me that any other human being could ever have meant so much to you as this one?
</p>
<p class="hang">
JULIAN (<i>more and more deeply moved, but speaking very quietly</i>) I shall not answer you.&#8212;In the end I should instinctively be tempted to make myself appear better than I am. You know very well how I have lived my life&#8212;that it has not followed a regulated and direct course like the lives of most other people. I suppose that the gift of bestowing happiness of the kind that lasts, or of accepting it, has never been mine.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's what I feel. It is what I have always felt. Often with something like regret&#8212;or sorrow almost. But just people like you, who are destined by their very nature to have many and varied experiences&#8212;just such people should, I think, cling more faithfully and more gratefully to memories of a tender, peaceful sort, like this&#8212;rather than to more passionate and saddening memories.&#8212;Am I not right?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Maybe you are.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
My mother had never before mentioned this picture to me. Isn't it strange?... That last night she did it for the first time.&#8212;We were left alone on the veranda. The rest had already bid me good-by.... And all of a sudden she began to talk about those summer days of long, long ago. Her words had an undercurrent of meanings which she probably did not realize. I believe that her own youth, which she had almost ceased to understand, was unconsciously taking mine into its confidence. It moved me more deeply than I can tell you.&#8212;Much as she cared for me, she had never before talked to me like that. And I believe that she had never been quite so dear to me as in those last moments.&#8212;And when finally I had to leave, I felt that she had still much more to tell me.&#8212;Now you'll understand why I had such a longing to see this picture.&#8212;I have almost the feeling that it might go on talking to me as my mother would have done&#8212;if I had only dared to ask her one more question!
</p>
<p>
JULIAN

<p class="indent">
Ask it now.... Do ask it, Felix.

FELIX (<i>who becomes aware of the emotion betrayed in the voice of Julian, looks up from the picture</i>)

FELIX

Why...?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well ... take it. I don't give it to you. As soon as I have settled down again, I shall want it back. But you shall have a look at it whenever you want. And I hope matters will be so arranged that you won't have far to go either.
</p>
<p>
FELIX (<i>with his eyes on the picture</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
It grows more alive every second.... And that look was directed at you.... That look...? Can it be possible that I read it right?

When Rolston went out there seven years ago, a lot of things happened which were not provided for in the original program. And they had to fight a regular battle, on a small scale, in the Kara-Kum district, not far from the river Amu-Daria.

<p>
REUMANN (<i>who has entered while Sala was speaking</i>)

To those who had to stay behind forever the scale of your battle was probably large enough. (<i>All greet each other and shake hands without letting the conversation be interrupted</i>)

In that respect you are probably right, Doctor.

SALA

I have received no direct request from anybody to speak of this. But after the conference which took place at the Foreign Department yesterday, and which I attended, I feel entitled to add a little more.&#8212;Oh, no secrets at all!&#8212;You have probably read, Felix, that a member of the General Staff as well as several artillery and engineering officers are being sent with us in what might be termed a semi-official capacity. On account of the latest news from Asia&#8212;which, however, does not seem very reliable to me, as it has come by way of England&#8212;it has been decided to secure the additional cooperation of some young line officers, and all arrangements of this kind must be left to private initiative.

Let me tell you, Mr. von Sala, that in the face of a venture like yours one might well express such doubts quite openly. But are you at all interested in whether you get back or not, Mr. von Sala? I don't suppose you belong to the kind of people who care to put their affairs in order.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, indeed. Especially not as, in cases of that kind, it is generally the affairs of others which give you needless trouble. If I were to be interested at all in my own chances, it would be for much more selfish reasons.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
What reasons?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I don't want to be cheated out of the consciousness that certain moments are my final ones.
</p>
<p>
REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
There are not many people who share your attitude in that respect.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
At any rate, Doctor, you would have to tell me the absolute truth if I ever asked you for it. I hold that one has the right to drain one's own life to the last drop, with all the horrors and delights that may lie hidden at the bottom of it. Just as it is our evident duty every day to commit every good deed and every rascality lying within our capacity.... No, I won't let you rob me of my death moments by any kind of hocus-pocus. It would imply a small-minded attitude, worthy neither of yourself nor of me.&#8212;Well, Felix, the twenty-sixth of November then! That's still seven weeks off. In regard to any formalities that may be required, you need have no worry at all.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
How long a time have I got to make up my mind?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
There's no reason to be precipitate. When does your furlough end?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
To-morrow night.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of course, you are going to talk it over with your father?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
With my father.... Yes, of course.&#8212;At any rate I'll bring you the answer early to-morrow morning, Mr. von Sala.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Fine. It would please me very much. But you must bear in mind: it will be no picnic. I expect to see you soon, then. Good-by, Miss Johanna. Farewell, Doctor.

FELIX

I hardly know why. And yet ... The thought of leaving people behind and perhaps never seeing them again&#8212;and certainly not as they were when you left them; the thought, too, that perhaps your going will hurt them ...
</p>

REUMANN
</p>
<p class="indent">
If nothing else makes you hesitate, then every moment of uncertainty is wasted. Nothing is more sure to estrange you from those dear to you than the knowledge that duty condemns you to stay near them. You must seize this unique opportunity. You must go to see Genoa, Asia Minor, Thibet, Bactria.... Oh, it must be splendid! And my best wishes will go with you. (<i>He gives his hand to Felix</i>)
</p>

FELIX

</p>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>brusquely</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
How could that help me or him? What can he be to me or I to him? I was not made to assist people in days of trial. I can't help it, but that's the way I am. I seem to be stirred by a sort of hostility against people who appeal to my pity. I felt it like that all the time mother was sick.
</p>
<p>
FELIX

No, you were not made for that.... But what were you made for then?

FELIX

Johanna, why do you never talk to me any more as you used to? Have you, then, nothing to tell me? Don't you remember how we used to tell each other everything?

JOHANNA

<p class="indent">
That was long ago. We were children then.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why can't you talk to me any longer as you did then? Have you forgotten how well we two used to understand each other? How we used to confide all our secrets to each other? What good chums we used to be?... How we wanted to go out into the wide world together?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Into the wide world.... Oh, yes, I remember. But there is nothing left now of all those words of wonder and romance.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Perhaps it depends on ourselves only.
</p>

JOHANNA

No, those words have no longer the same meaning as before.

<p class="indent">
What is the matter, Johanna?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Once, when we were in the museum together, I saw a picture of which I often think. It has a meadow with knights and ladies in it&#8212;and a forest, a vineyard, an inn, and young men and women dancing, and a big city with churches and towers and bridges. And soldiers are marching across the bridges, and a ship is gliding down the river. And farther back there is a hill, and on that hill a castle, and lofty mountains in the extreme distance. And clouds are floating above the mountains, and there is mist on the meadow, and a flood of sunlight is pouring down on the city, and a storm is raging over the castle, and there is ice and snow on the mountains.&#8212;And when anybody spoke of "the wide world," or I read that term anywhere, I used always to think of that picture. And it used to be the same with so many other big-sounding words. Fear was a tiger with cavernous mouth&#8212;love was a page with long light curls kneeling at the feet of a lady&#8212;death was a beautiful young man with black wings and a sword in his hand&#8212;and fame was blaring bugles, men with bent backs, and a road strewn with flowers. In those days it was possible to talk of all sorts of things, Felix. But to-day everything has a different look&#8212;fame, and death, and love, and the wide world.
</p>
<p>
FELIX (<i>hesitatingly</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
I feel a little scared on your behalf, Johanna.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why, Felix?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Johanna!&#8212;I wish you wouldn't do anything to worry father.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Does that depend on me alone?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I know in what direction your dreams are going, Johanna.&#8212;What is to come out of that?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Is it necessary that something comes out of everything?&#8212;I think, Felix, that many people are destined to mean nothing to each other but a common memory.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
You have said it yourself, Johanna&#8212;that you are not made to see other people suffer.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA (<i>shrinks slightly at those words</i>)

So I have heard.

WEGRAT

No, you haven't had much chance for it.... But I.... As I enter the building where I now hold office and authority, I remember often how we two young chaps used to sit side by side in the model class, full of a thousand plans and hopes.

Why do you say that in such a melancholy tone? A lot of those things have come true, haven't they?
</p>

Some&#8212;yes.... And yet one can't help wanting to be young again, even at the risk of similar sorrows and struggles....

And even at the risk of also having to live through a lot of nice things over again.

Indeed, those are the hardest things to bear, once they have turned into memories.&#8212;You have been in Italy again?

<p class="indent">
Yes, in Italy too.

That must have been almost thirty years ago.

How the light buggy carried us through the wide, sun-steeped valley? And do you remember the little garden at H&#252;gelhang, where you became acquainted with Gabrielle and her parents?

<p class="indent">
Father, is the house in which mother used to live still standing?

WEGRAT

<p class="indent">
No, it's gone long ago. They have built a villa on the spot. Five or six years ago, you know, we went there for the last time to visit the graves of your grandparents. Everything has been changed, except the cemetery.... (<i>To Julian</i>) Can you still remember that cool, cloudy afternoon, Julian, when we sat on the lower wall of the cemetery and had such a remarkable talk about the future?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I remember the day very clearly. But I have entirely forgotten what we were talking about.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Just what we said has passed out of my mind, too, but I can still remember what an extraordinary talk it was.... In some way the world seemed to open up more widely. And I felt something like envy toward you, as I often did in those days. There rose within me a feeling that I, too, could do anything&#8212;if I only wanted. There was so much to be seen and experienced&#8212;and the flow of life was irresistible. Nothing would be needed but a little more nerve, a little more self-assurance, and then to plunge in. ... Yes, that was what I felt while you were talking. ... And then Gabrielle came toward us along the narrow road from the village, between the acacias. She carried her straw hat in her hand, and she nodded to me. And all my dreams of the future centered in her after that, and once more the whole world seemed fitted into a frame, and yet it was big and beautiful enough. ... Why does the color all of a sudden come back into those things? It was practically forgotten, all of it, and now, when she is dead, it comes to life again with a glow that almost scares me. ... Oh, it were better not to think of it at all. What's the use? What's the use? (<i>Pause; he goes to one of the windows</i>)
</p>

It seems to me that your grief makes you a little unjust toward&#8212;much that is still yours.

<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Unjust...? Oh, I didn't mean to. I hope you don't feel hurt, children ...! Felix, you understand me fully, don't you? There is so much, from the very beginning, that draws&#8212;that lures&#8212;that tears the young ones away from us. We have to struggle to keep our children almost from the very moment they arrive&#8212;and the struggle is a pretty hopeless one at that. But that's the way of life: they cannot possibly belong to us. And as far as other people are concerned.... Even our friends come into our lives only as guests who rise from the table when they have eaten, and walk out. Like us, they have their own streets, their own affairs. And it's quite natural it should be so.... Which doesn't prevent us from feeling pleased, Julian&#8212;sincerely pleased, when one of them finds his way back to us. Especially if it be one on whom we have put great store throughout life. You may be sure of that, Julian. (<i>They shake hands</i>) And as long as you remain in Vienna, I shall see you here quite often, I trust. It will give me genuine pleasure.

It had been arranged that we were to go away together. Everything was ready. We meant to leave the place secretly because, quite naturally, your mother shrank from any kind of statement or explanation. Our intention was to write and explain after we had been gone a few days. The hour of our start had already been settled. He ... who later became her husband, had just gone to Vienna for a couple of days in order to get certain documents. The wedding was to take place in a week. (<i>Pause</i>) Our plans were all made. We had agreed on everything. The carriage that was to pick us up a little ways off had already been hired. In the evening we bade each other good-night, fully convinced that we should meet next morning, never to part again.&#8212;It turned out differently.&#8212;You mustn't keep in mind that it was your mother.

I had come to Kirchau in June, one beautiful Summer morning&#8212;with him.... You know about that, don't you? I meant to stay only a few days. But I stayed on and on. More than once I tried to get away while it was still time. But I stayed. (<i>Smiling</i>) And with fated inevitability we slipped into sin, happiness, doom, betrayal&#8212;and dreams. Yes, indeed, there was more of those than of anything else. And after that last farewell, meant to be for a night only&#8212;as I got back to the little inn and started to make things ready for our journey&#8212;only then did I for the first time become really conscious of what had happened and was about to happen. Actually, it was almost as if I had just waked up. Only then, in the stillness of that night, as I was standing at the open window, did it grow clear to me that next morning an hour would come by which my whole future must be determined. And then I began to feel ... as if faint shiverings had been streaming down my body. Below me I could see the stretch of road along which I had just come. It ran on and on through the country, climbing the hills that cut off the view, and losing itself in the open, the limitless.... It led to thousands of unknown and invisible roads, all of which at that moment remained at my disposal. It seemed to me as if my future, radiant with glory and adventure, lay waiting for me behind those hills&#8212;but for me alone. Life was mine&#8212;but only this one life. And in order to seize it and enjoy it fully&#8212;in order to live it as it had been shaped for me by fate&#8212;I needed the carelessness and freedom I had enjoyed until then. And I marveled almost at my own readiness to give away the recklessness of my youth and the fullness of my existence.... And to what purpose?&#8212;For the sake of a passion which, after all, despite its ardor and its transports, had begun like many others, and would be destined to end like all of them.

<p>
FELIX

<p class="indent">
Destined to end...?
<i>
Must
</i>
come to an end?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes. Must. The moment I foresaw the end, I had in a measure reached it. To wait for something that must come, means to go through it a thousand times&#8212;to go through it helplessly and needlessly and resentfully. This I felt acutely at that moment. And it frightened me. At the same time I felt clearly that I was about to act like a brute and a traitor toward a human being who had given herself to me in full confidence.&#8212;But everything seemed more desirable&#8212;not only for me, but for her also&#8212;than a slow, miserable, unworthy decline. And all my scruples were submerged in a monstrous longing to go on with my life as before, without duties or ties. There wasn't much time left for consideration. And I was glad of it. I had made up my mind. I didn't wait for the morning. Before the stars had set, I was off.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
You ran away....
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Call it anything you please.&#8212;Yes, it was a flight, just as good and just as bad, just as precipitate and just as cowardly as any other&#8212;with all the horrors of being pursued and all the joys of escaping. I am hiding nothing from you, Felix. You are still young, and it is even possible that you may understand it better than I can understand it myself to-day. Nothing pulled me back. No remorse stirred within me. The sense of being free filled me with intoxication.... At the end of the first day I was already far away&#8212;much farther than any number of milestones could indicate. On that first day her image began to fade away already&#8212;the image of her who had waked up to meet painful disillusionment, or worse maybe. The ring of her voice was passing out of my memory.... She was becoming a shadow like others that had been left floating much farther behind me in the past.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, it isn't true! So quickly could she not be forgotten. So remorselessly could you not go out in the world. All this is meant as a sort of expiation. You make yourself appear what you are not.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I am not telling you these things to accuse or defend myself. I am simply telling you the truth. And you must hear it. It was your mother, and I am the man who deserted her. And there is something more I am compelled to tell you. On the very time that followed my flight I must look back as the brightest and richest of any I have ever experienced. Never before or after have I reveled to such an extent in the splendid consciousness of my youth and my freedom from restraint. Never have I been so wholly master of my gifts and of my life.... Never have I been a happier man than I was at that very time.
</p>
<p>
FELIX (<i>calmly</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
And if she had killed herself?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
I believe I should have thought myself worth it&#8212;in those days.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
And so you were, perhaps, at that time.&#8212;And she thought of doing it, I am sure. She wanted to put an end to the lies and the qualms, just as hundreds of thousands of girls have done before. But millions fail to do it, and they are the most sensible ones. And I am sure she also thought of telling the truth to him she took to husband. But, of course, the way through life is easier when you don't have to carry a burden of reproach or, what is worse, of forgiveness.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And if she had spoken....
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I understand why she didn't. It had been of no use to anybody. And so she kept silent: silent when she got back from the wedding&#8212;silent when her child was born&#8212;silent when, ten years later, the lover came to her husband's house again&#8212;silent to the very last.... Fates of that kind are to be found everywhere, and it isn't even necessary to be&#8212;depraved, in order to suffer them or invoke them.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And there are mighty few whom it behooves to judge&#8212;or to condemn.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
I don't presume to do so. And it doesn't even occur to me that I am now to behold deceivers and deceived where, a few hours ago, I could only see people who were dear to me and whose relationships to each other were perfectly pure. And it is absolutely impossible for me to feel myself another man than I have deemed myself until to-day. There is no power in all this truth.... A vivid dream would be more compelling than this story out of bygone days, which you have just told me. Nothing has changed&#8212;nothing whatever. The thought of my mother is as sacred to me as ever. And the man in whose house I was born and raised, who surrounded my childhood and youth with care tenderness, and whom my mother&#8212;loved.... He means just as much to me now as he ever meant&#8212;and perhaps a little more.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And yet, Felix, however powerless this truth may seem to you&#8212;there is one thing you can take hold of in this moment of doubt: it was as my son your mother gave birth to you....
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
At a time when you had run away from her.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And as my son she brought you up.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
In hatred of you.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
At first. Later in forgiveness, and finally&#8212;don't forget it&#8212;in friendship toward me.... And what was in her mind that last night?&#8212;Of what did she talk to you?&#8212;Of those days when she experienced the greatest happiness that can fall to the share of any woman.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
As well as the greatest misery.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Do you think it was mere chance which brought those very days back to her mind that last evening?... Don't you think she knew that you would go to me and ask for that picture?... And do you think your wish to see it could have any other meaning than of a final greeting to me from your mother?... Can't you understand that, Felix?... And in this moment&#8212;don't try to resist&#8212;you have it before your eyes&#8212;that picture you held in your hand yesterday: and your mother is looking at you.&#8212;And the glance resting on you, Felix, is the same one that rested on me that passionate and sacred day when she fell into my arms and you were conceived.&#8212;And whatever you may feel of doubt or confusion, the truth has now been revealed to you once for all. Thus your mother willed it, and it is no longer possible for you to forget that you are my son.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Your son.... That's nothing but a word. And it's cried in a desert.&#8212;Although I am looking at you now, and although I know that I am your son, I can't grasp it.
</p>

THE FOURTH ACT
</p>
<p>
<i>
The garden belonging to Mr. von Sala's house. At the left is seen the white, one-storied building, fronted by a broad terrace, from which six stone steps lead down into the garden. A wide door with panes of glass leads from the terrace into the drawing-room. A small pool appears in the foreground, surrounded by a semi-circle of young trees. From that spot an avenue of trees runs diagonally across the stage toward the right. At the opening of the avenue, near the pool, stand two columns on which are placed the marble busts of two Roman emperors. A semi-circular stone seat with back support stands under the trees to the right of the pool. Farther back glimpses of the glittering fence are caught through the scanty leafage. Back of the fence, the woods on a gently rising hillside are turning red. The autumnal sky is pale blue. Everything is quiet. The stage remains empty for a few moments.

</p>

Sala and Johanna enter by way of the terrace. She is in black. He has on a gray suit and carries a dark overcoat across his shoulders. They descend the steps slowly.

</p>
<br>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I think you'll find it rather cool. (<i>He goes back into the room, picks up a cape lying there, and puts it around Johanna's shoulders; little by little they reach the garden</i>)
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Do you know what I imagine?... That this day is our own&#8212;that it belongs to us alone. We have summoned it, and if we wanted, we could make it stay.... All other people live only as guests in the world to-day. Isn't that so?... The reason is, I suppose, that once I heard you speak of this day.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of this...?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes&#8212;while mother was still living.... And now it has really come. The leaves are red. The golden mist is lying over the woods. The sky is pale and remote&#8212;and the day is even more beautiful, and sadder, than I could ever have imagined. And I am spending it in your garden, and your pool is my mirror. (<i>She stands looking down into the pool</i>) And yet we can no more make it stay, this golden day, than the water here can hold my image after I have gone away.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
It seems strange that this clear, mild air should be tinged with a suggestion of winter and snow.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why should it trouble you? When that suggestion has become reality here, you are already in the midst of another Spring.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
What do you mean by that?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I suppose that where you go they have no winter like ours.
</p>
<p>
SALA (<i>pensively</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, not like ours. (<i>Pause</i>) And you?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA

<p class="indent">
I...?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
What are you going to do, I mean, when I am gone?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
When you are gone...? (<i>She looks at him, and he stands staring into the distance</i>) Haven't you gone long ago? And at bottom, are you not far away from me even now?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
What are you saying? I am here with you.... What are you going to do, Johanna?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I have already told you. Go away&#8212;just like you.
</p>
<p>
SALA (<i>shakes his head</i>)
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
As soon as possible. I have still the courage left. Who knows what may become of me later, if I stay here alone.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
As long as you are young, all doors stand open, and the world begins outside every one of them.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
But the world is wide and the sky infinite only as long as you are not clinging to anybody. And for that reason I want to go away.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Away&#8212;that's so easily said. But preparations are needed for that purpose, and some sort of a scheme. You use the word as if you merely had to put on wings and fly off into the distance.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
To be determined is&#8212;the same as having wings.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Are you not at all afraid, Johanna?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
A longing free from fear would be too cheap to be worth while.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Where will it lead you?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I shall find my way.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
You can choose your way, but not the people that you meet.
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Do you think me ignorant of the fact that I cannot expect only beautiful experiences? What is ugly and mean must also be waiting for me.
</p>
<p>
SALA

<p class="indent">
And how are you going to stand it?&#8212;Will you be able to stand it at all?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of course, I am not going to tell the truth always as I have done to you. I shall have to lie&#8212;and I think of it with pleasure. I shall not always be in good spirits, nor always sensible. I shall make mistakes and suffer. That's the way it has to be, I suppose.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Of all this you are aware in advance, and yet...?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And why?... Why are you going away, Johanna?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why am I going away?... I want a time to come when I must shudder at myself. Shudder as deeply as you can only when nothing has been left untried. Just as you have had to do when you looked back upon your life. Or have you not?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, many times. But just in such moments of shuddering there is nothing left behind at all&#8212;everything is once more present. And the present is the past. (<i>He sits down on the stone seat</i>)
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
What do you mean by that?

I am a child, riding my pony across the fields. My father is behind and calls to me. At that window waits my mother. She has thrown a gray satin shawl over her dark hair and is waving her hand at me.... And I am a young lieutenant in maneuvers, standing on a hillock and reporting to my colonel that hostile infantry is ambushed behind that wooded piece of ground, ready to charge, and down below us I can see the midday sun glittering on bayonets and buttons.... And I am lying alone in my boat adrift, looking up into the deep-blue Summer sky, while words of incomprehensible beauty are shaping themselves in my mind&#8212;words more beautiful than I have ever been able to put on paper.... And I am resting on a bench in the cool park at the lake of Lugano, with Helen sitting beside me; she holds a book with red cover in her hand; over there by the magnolia, Lillie is playing with the light-haired English boy, and I can hear them prattling and laughing.... And I am walking slowly back and forth with Julian on a bed of rustling leaves, and we are talking of a picture which we saw yesterday. And I see the picture: two old sailors with worn-out faces, who are seated on an overturned skiff, their sad eyes directed toward the boundless sea. And I feel their misery more deeply than the artist who painted them; more deeply than they could have felt it themselves, had they been alive.... All this&#8212;all of it is there&#8212;if I only close my eyes. It is nearer to me than you, Johanna, when I don't see you and you keep quiet.

JOHANNA (<i>stands looking at him with wistful sympathy</i>)

SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
The present&#8212;what does it mean anyhow? Are we then locked breast to breast with the moment as with a friend whom we embrace&#8212;or an enemy who is pressing us? Has not the word that just rings out turned to memory already? Is not the note that starts a melody reduced to memory before the song is ended? Is your coming to this garden anything but a memory, Johanna? Are not your steps across that meadow as much a matter of the past as are the steps of creatures dead these many years?
</p>
<p>
JOHANNA
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, it mustn't be like that. It makes me sad.
</p>
<p>
SALA (<i>with a return to present things</i>)

I know. Why do you repeat it? Do you think, perhaps, that all at once I may begin to clutch at you like a love-sick thing, dreaming of eternities?&#8212;No, that isn't my way&#8212;oh, no!... But I want to tell you once at least that I am fond of you. May I not for once?&#8212;Do you hear? I love you. And I wish that sometime later on you may hear it just as I am saying it now&#8212;at some other moment no less beautiful than this&#8212;when we two shall no longer be aware of each other.

<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Indeed, Johanna, of one thing you may be sure: that the sound of your voice shall never leave me.&#8212;But why should we talk of parting forever? Perhaps we shall meet again sooner or later ... in three years ... or in five.... (<i>With a smile</i>) Then you have become a princess perhaps, and I may be the ruler of some buried city....

<p class="indent">
Well, yes&#8212;I am thinking of that remarkable article in the Daily Post.
</p>
<p>
SALA

<p class="indent">
Concerning what?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
What is going on at the Caspian Sea.
</p>
<p>
SALA

<p class="indent">
Oh, are the local papers also taking that up?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
The conditions in certain regions through which you have to pass seem really to be extremely dangerous.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Exaggerations. We have better information than that. According to my opinion there is nothing back of those articles but the petty jealousy of English scientists. What you read had been translated from the Daily News. And it's fully three weeks since it appeared there.&#8212;Have you seen Felix, by the way?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
He was at my house only last night. And this morning I called on the Wegrats. He wanted to have a look at that picture of his mother which I painted twenty-three years ago.&#8212;And one thing and another led to my telling him everything.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, you did? (<i>Thoughtfully</i>) And how did he take it?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
It stirred him rather more than I had thought possible.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, I hope you didn't expect him to fall into your arms as the recovered son does in the play.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, of course not.&#8212;I told him everything, without any attempt at sparing myself. And for that reason he seemed to feel the wrong done to his mother's husband more strongly than anything else. But that won't last very long. He'll soon understand that, in the higher sense, no wrong has been done at all. People of Wegrat's type are not made to hold actual possession of anything&#8212;whether it be wives or children. They mean a refuge, a dwelling place&#8212;but never a real home. Can you understand what I mean by that? It is their mission to take into their arms creatures who have been worn out or broken to pieces by some kind of passion. But they never guess whence such creatures come. And while it is granted them to attract and befriend, they never understand whither those creatures go. They exist for the purpose of sacrificing themselves unconsciously, and in such sacrifices they find a happiness that might seem a pretty poor one to others.... You are not saying a word?
</p>
<p>
SALA

<p class="indent">
I am listening.

And then I got out and followed a road that I remembered since many years ago. (<i>She looks at Julian</i>) I rested on a bench where I sat once many, many years ago, with a close friend. (<i>Smilingly</i>) Can you guess, Mr. Fichtner? The outlook is wonderful. Beyond the fields you have a perfect view of the whole city as far as the Danube.

You don't need to answer me. The matter has been in my mind all the time.... The only thing I can't understand is why I haven't discovered it before.

<p>
SALA (<i>accompanies Irene and Felix up the steps to the terrace</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
JULIAN (<i>remains behind, walking back and forth; after a while he is joined by Sala</i>) Have you no doubt that your appeal to Count Ronsky will be effective?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I have already received definite assurances from him, or I should never have aroused any hopes in Felix.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
What caused you to do this, Sala?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
My sympathy for Felix, I should say, and the fact that I like to travel in pleasant company.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And did it never occur to you, that the thought of losing him might be very painful to me?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
What's the use of that, Julian? It is only possible to lose what you possess. And you cannot possess a thing to which you have not acquired any right. You know that as well as I do.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Does not, in the last instance, the fact that you need somebody give you a certain claim on him?&#8212;Can't you understand, Sala, that he represents my last hope?... That actually I haven't got anything or anybody left but him?... That wherever I turn, I find nothing but emptiness?... That I am horrified by the loneliness awaiting me?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
And what could it help you if he stayed? And even if he felt something like filial tenderness toward you, how could that help you?... How can he or anybody else help you?... You say that loneliness horrifies you?... And if you had a wife by your side to-day, wouldn't you be lonely just the same?... Wouldn't you be lonely even if you were surrounded by children and grandchildren?... Suppose you had kept your money, your fame and your genius&#8212;don't you think you would be lonely for all that?... Suppose we were always attended by a train of bacchantes&#8212;nevertheless we should have to tread the downward path alone&#8212;we, who have never belonged to anybody ourselves. The process of aging must needs be a lonely one for our kind, and he is nothing but a fool who doesn't in time prepare himself against having to rely on any human being.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
And do you imagine, Sala, that you need no human being?
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
In the manner I have used them they will always be at my disposal. I have always been in favor of keeping at a certain distance. It is not my fault that other people haven't realized it.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
In that respect you are right, Sala. For you have never really loved anybody in this world.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Perhaps not. And how about you? No more than I, Julian.... To love means to live for the sake of somebody else. I don't say that it is a more desirable form of existence, but I do think, at any rate, that you and I have been pretty far removed from it. What has that which one like us brings into the world got to do with love? Though it include all sorts of funny, hypocritical, tender, unworthy, passionate things that pose as love&#8212;it isn't love for all that.... Have we ever made a sacrifice by which our sensuality or our vanity didn't profit?... Have we ever hesitated to betray or blackguard decent people, if by doing so we could gain an hour of happiness or of mere lust?... Have we ever risked our peace or our lives&#8212;not out of whim or recklessness&#8212;but to promote the welfare of someone who had given all to us?... Have we ever denied ourselves an enjoyment unless from such denial we could at least derive some comfort?... And do you think that we could dare to turn to any human being, man or woman, with a demand that any gift of ours be returned? I am not thinking of pearls now, or annuities, or cheap wisdom, but of some piece of our real selves, some hour of our own existence, which we have surrendered to such a being without at once exacting payment for it in some sort of coin. My dear Julian, we have kept our doors open, and have allowed our treasures to be viewed&#8212;but prodigal with them we have never been. You no more than I. We may just as well join hands, Julian. I am a little less prone to complain than you are&#8212;that's the whole difference.... But I am not telling you anything new. All this you know as well as I do. It is simply impossible for us not to know ourselves. Of course, we try at times conscientiously to deceive ourselves, but it never works. Our follies and rascalities may remain hidden to others&#8212;but never to ourselves. In our innermost souls we always know what to think of ourselves.&#8212;It's getting cold, Julian. Let's go indoors.
</p>
<p class="indent">
(<i>They begin to ascend the steps to the terrace</i>)
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
All that may be true, Sala. But this much you have to grant me. If there be anybody in the world who has no right to make us pay for the mistakes of our lives, it is a person who has us to thank for his own life.
</p>
<p>
SALA
</p>
<p class="indent">
There is no question of payment in this. Your son has a mind for essentials, Julian. You have said so yourself. And he feels that to have done nothing for a man but to put him into the world, is to have done very little indeed.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Then, at least, everything must become as it was before he knew anything at all. Once more I shall become to him a human being like anybody else. Then he will not dare to leave me.... I cannot bear it. How have I deserved that he should run away from me?... And even if all that I have held for good and true within myself&#8212;even if, in the end, my very fondness for this young man, who is my son&#8212;should prove nothing but self-delusion&#8212;yet I love him now.... Do you understand me, Sala? I love him, and all I ask is that he may believe it before I must lose him forever....

[<i>It grows dark. The two men pass across the terrace and enter the drawing-room. The stage stands empty a little while. In the meantime the wind has risen somewhat. Johanna enters by the avenue of trees from the right and goes past the pool toward the terrace. The windows of the drawing-room are illumined. Sala has seated himself at a table. The valet enters the room and serves him a glass of wine. Johanna stops. She is apparently much excited. Then she ascends two of the steps to the terrace. Sala seems to hear a noise and turns his head slightly. When she sees this, Johanna hurries down again and stops beside the pool. There she stands looking down into the water.

I thought it rather possible that he might have a suspicion, or be able to give us some kind of direction. But he knows nothing at all. That was perfectly clear. And if he had known anything&#8212;had known anything definite&#8212;he would have told me. I am sure of that. He was still in bed when I called on him.

To think that you can watch a young creature like her grow up&#8212;can see the child turn into girl, and then into a young lady&#8212;can speak hundreds of thousands of words to her.... And one day she rises from the table, puts on hat and coat, and goes ... and you have no idea as to whether she has slipped away&#8212;if into nothingness or into a new life.

FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
But whatever may have happened, father&#8212;she wanted to get away from us. And in that fact, I think, we should find a certain consolation.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT (<i>shakes his head in perplexity</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Everything is fluttering away&#8212;willingly or unwillingly&#8212;but away it goes.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Father, we can't tell what may have happened. It's conceivable, at least, that Johanna may have formed some decision which she does not carry out. Perhaps she will come back in a few hours, or days.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
You believe ... you think it possible, do you?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Possible&#8212;yes. But if she shouldn't come&#8212;of course, father, I shall give up the plan of which I told you yesterday. Under circumstances like these I couldn't think of going so far away from you for such a long time.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT (<i>to Julian</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
And now he's going to sacrifice himself for my sake!
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Perhaps I could arrange to have myself transferred here.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, Felix, you know very well that I couldn't accept such a thing.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
But it's no sacrifice. I assure you, father, that I stay with you only because I
<i>
can't
</i>
go away from you now.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, yes, Felix, you can&#8212;you will be able. And you are not to stay here for my sake&#8212;you mustn't. I could never be sure that it would prove of any help to me to have you give up a plan which you have taken hold of with such enthusiasm. I think it would be inexcusable of you to draw back, and wicked of me to permit it. You must be happy at having found a way at last, by which you may reach all you have longed for. It makes me happy, too, Felix. If you missed this opportunity, you would regret it all your life.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
But so much may have changed since yesterday&#8212;such a tremendous lot&#8212;for you and for me.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
For me, perhaps.... But never mind. I won't stand it&#8212;I will not accept such a sacrifice. Of course, I might accept it, if I could find it of any special advantage to myself. But I shouldn't have you any more than if you were gone away ... less ... not at all. This fate that has descended on us must not add to its inherent power what is still worse&#8212;that it makes us do in our confusion what is against our own natures. Sometime we always get over every disaster, no matter how frightful it be. But whatever we do in violation of our innermost selves can never be undone. (<i>Turning to Julian</i>) Isn't that true, Julian?
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
You are absolutely right.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Thanks, father. I feel grateful that you make it so easy for me to agree with you.
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's good, Felix.... During the weeks you will remain in Europe we shall be able to talk over a lot of things&#8212;more perhaps than in the years gone by. Indeed, how little people know about each other!... But I am getting tired. We stayed awake all night.
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Won't you rest a while, father?
</p>

WEGRAT

Rest.... You'll stay at home, Felix, won't you?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, I shall wait right here. What else is there to do?
</p>
<p>
WEGRAT
</p>
<p class="indent">
I'm racking my brain until it's near bursting.... Why didn't she say anything to me? Why have I known so little about her? Why have I kept so far away from her? (<i>He goes out</i>)

How that man has been belied&#8212;all his life long&#8212;by all of us.
</p>

JULIAN

There is in this world no sin, no crime, no deception, that cannot be atoned. Only for what has happened here, there should be no expiation and no forgetfulness, you think?
</p>
<p>
FELIX
</p>
<p class="indent">
Can it be possible that you don't understand?... Here a lie has been eternalized. There is no getting away from it. And she who did it was my mother&#8212;and it was you who made her do it&#8212;and the lie am I, and such I must remain as long as I am passing for that which I am not.
</p>
<p>
JULIAN
</p>
<p class="indent">
Let us proclaim the truth then, Felix.&#8212;I shall face any judge that you may choose, and submit to any verdict passed on me.&#8212;Must I alone remain condemned forever? Should I alone, among all that have erred, never dare to say: "It is atoned"?
</p>

It is too late. Guilt can be wiped out by confession only while the guilty one is still able to make restitution. You ought to know yourself, that this respite expired long ago.

SALA

Her farewell words to me were: Until to-morrow. You can see that I had every reason to be surprised this morning, when you appeared at my house. Permit me furthermore to tell you, that yesterday, of all days, I asked Johanna to become my wife&#8212;which seemed to agitate her very much. In telling you this, I have by no means the intention of smoothing over things. For my question implied no desire on my part to make good any wrong I might have done. It was apparently nothing but a whim&#8212;like so much else. There is here no question of anything but to let you know the truth. This means that I am at your disposal in any manner you may choose.&#8212;I thought it absolutely necessary to say all this before we were brought to the point of having to descend into the depths of the earth together, or, perhaps, to sleep in the same tent.

There is a blue-greenish glitter on the water, and besides, the shadow of the beech tree falls right across it early in the morning. And by a strange coincidence Johanna said yesterday: "The water can no more hold my image...." That was, in a way, like challenging fate.... And as I passed by the pool, it was as if ... the water had retained her image just the same.

Is that true?

Of course, I do. Would you expect me to wait for it? That would be rather painful, I think. (<i>To Julian, with a smile</i>) From whom are you now going to get your cues, my dear friend? Yes, it's all over now.... And what has become of it?... Where are the

of Caracalla? Where is the park at Lugano?... Where is my nice little house?... No nearer to me, and no farther away, than those marble steps leading down to mysterious depths.... Veils in front of everything.... Perhaps your son will discover if the three-hundred and twelfth be the last one&#8212;and if not, it won't give him much concern anyhow.... Don't you think he has been acting rather nicely?... I have somehow the impression that a better generation is growing up&#8212;with more poise and less brilliancy.&#8212;Send your regards to heaven, Julian.

<p class="head">
THE FIRST ACT
</p>
<p>
<i>
The study of Amadeus. The walls are painted in dark gray, with a very simple frieze. A door in the background leads to a veranda. On either side of this door is a window. Through the door one sees the garden, to which three steps lead down from the veranda. A cabinet stands between the door and the window at the right; a music-stand holds a corresponding position to the left of the door. Antique bas-reliefs are hung above the cabinet as well as the stand. The main entrance is on the right side in the foreground. Farther back at the right is a door leading to Cecilia's room. A door finished like the rest of the wall leads to the room of Amadeus at the left. A tall book case, with a bust of Verrochio on top of it, stands against the right wall. In the corner back of it are several columns with tall vases full of flowers. A fireplace occupies the foreground at the left. Above it is a large mirror. On the mantelshelf stands a French clock of simple design. A table surrounded by chairs is placed in front of the fireplace. Farther back along the same wall are shelves piled with sheet music, and above them engravings of Schumann, Brahms, Mozart, and other composers. A bust of Beethoven occupies the farthermost corner at the left. Halfway down the stage, nearer the left wall, stands a piano with a piano stool in front of it. An armchair has been moved up close to the piano on the side toward the public. A writing desk holds a similar position at the right. Back of it are an easy-chair and a couch, the latter having been moved close to the table.

anything</i>. Tell the director, please, that I send him my regards and that&#8212;there are more important things to occupy my time. (<i>He closes the score</i>)

For the Lord's sake, please don't pretend to be interested in things of that kind! Why, nobody expects it of you.

</p>
<p class="indent">
Will it soon be finished?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Finished...? How could it be, do you think? I have to conduct two nights a week at least, and there are rehearsals in the morning, not to mention singers that have to be coached.... Do you think a man can sit down after an hour like
<i>
this
</i>
and invite his muse?
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
After an hour like
<i>
this</i>...? I don't think you feel quite at your ease with me, Amadeus.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Not at my ease? I? With you?&#8212;I don't think you have imagined in your most reckless moments, Countess, that my wife might have anything to fear from you.
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
You are determined to misunderstand me. (<i>She has gone to the fireplace and turns now to face Amadeus</i>) You know perfectly well why you pretend to be cross with me. Because you are in love with me.
</p>

AMADEUS (<i>looks straight ahead and goes on playing</i>)

<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
And that chord proves nothing to the contrary.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
That chord.... Tell me rather what kind of chord it is. (<i>He repeats it in a fury</i>)
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
A flat major.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS (<i>in a tone of boredom</i>)

G major&#8212;of course.

<p>
FREDERIQUE (<i>close by him, with a smile</i>)

Don't let that semi-tone spoil our happiness.

AMADEUS (<i>rises, goes toward the background and looks out into the garden</i>)
</p>

FREDERIQUE

<p class="indent">
Is it your wife?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, my little boy is playing out there. (<i>He stands at the window, waving his hand at somebody outside; pause</i>)
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
You take life too hard, Amadeus.
</p>
<p class="hang">
AMADEUS (<i>still at the window, but turning toward Frederique</i>) I can't lie&#8212;and I don't want to. Which is not the same as taking life hard.
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Can't lie...? And yet you have been away from your wife for months at a time&#8212;haven't you? And your wife came here while you were still conducting somewhere abroad, didn't she?... So that....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Those are matters which you don't quite comprehend, Countess. (<i>He looks again toward the main entrance</i>)
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, your wife can't be here yet. She won't give up her walk on a wonderful day like this.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
What you have in mind now is pretty mean, Frederique.
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why so? Of course, I know she takes a walk with you, too, now and then.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, when my time permits. And often she goes out with Sigismund. To-day she's probably with him&#8212;and that's what you wanted to bring home to me, of course.
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why should I? You know it, don't you? And I assure you, it has never occurred to me to see anything wrong in it. He's a friend of yours.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
More than that&#8212;or less. He used to be my pupil.
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I didn't know that.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Ten years ago, while still a mere youngster, I used to live in his father's palace. It's hard to tell where I might have been to-day, had it not been for old Prince Lohsenstein. You see, we men have generally another kind of youth to look back at than you ...
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
... women artists.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, countesses, I meant to say. For three years I spent every summer in the palace at Krumau.<a href="#note1a" name="noteref1a"><sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>
</a>
And there&#8212;for the first time in my life&#8212;I could work in peace, all by myself, with nothing more to do than to instruct Sigismund.
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Did he want to become a pianist?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Not exactly. He wanted to join some monastic order.
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
No? Is that really true?&#8212;Oh, it's queer how people change!
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
They don't as much as you think. He has remained a man of serious mind.
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
And yet he plays dance music so charmingly...?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why shouldn't he? A good waltz and a good hymn are just as acceptable to the powers above.
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
How delightful those evenings in your house used to be! No farther back than last winter.... The Count and I frequently talk of them.&#8212;Have you ceased to invite Prince Sigismund, as you have me?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
He was here only a fortnight ago, my dear Countess&#8212;and spent the whole evening with us. We had supper in the summer-house, and then we came in here and sat chatting for a long while, and finally he improvised some variations on the Cagliostro Waltzes before he left.&#8212;And what my wife and he say to each other during their walk, when I am not with them, will no more be hidden from me than I would hide from her what you and I have been talking of here. That's how my wife and I feel toward each other&#8212;if you'll please understand, Frederique!
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
But there are things one simply
<i>
can't
</i>
say to each other.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
There can be no secrets between people like my wife and myself.
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, of course ... but then ... what you have been saying to me will be only a small part of what you must tell your wife to-day, Amadeus. Good-by.... (<i>She holds out her hand to him</i>)
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
What's in your mind now, Frederique?
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why resist your fate? Is it so very repulsive after all? What you are to me, nobody else has ever been!
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
And you want me to believe that?
</p>
<p>
FREDERIQUE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I shall not insist on it. But it is true nevertheless. Good-by now. Until to-morrow, Amadeus. Life is really much easier than you think.... It might be so very pleasant&#8212;and so it shall be! (<i>She goes out</i>)
</p>
<p class="hang">
AMADEUS (<i>seats himself at the piano again and strikes a few notes</i>) It is getting serious ... or amusing perhaps...? (<i>He shakes his head</i>)
</p>
<p class="hang">
ALBERT RHON (<i>enters; he is of medium height; his black hair, slightly streaked with gray, is worn long; he is rather carelessly dressed</i>)
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, is that you, Albert? How are you?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
I have come to ask how you are getting along with our opera, Amadeus. Have you done anything?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
No.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Again nothing?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
I doubt whether I can get a chance here. We'll have to wait until the season is over. I have too much to do. We are now putting on "Mignon" with new people in some of the parts....
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
If I'm not very much mistaken, I saw Philine float by&#8212;with a rather intoxicated look in her eyes.... Oh, have I put my foot into it again? I beg your pardon!
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS (<i>turning away from him</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's right. She was here. Oh, that damned business of private rehearsals! But I hope it won't last much longer. The coming Winter is going to decide my future once for all. I have already got my leave of absence.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
So you have made up your mind about that tour?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, I shall be gone for two months this time.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Within Germany only?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
I'll probably take in a few Italian cities also. Yes, my dear fellow, they know more about me abroad than here. I shall conduct my Third Symphony, and perhaps also my Fourth.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Have you got that far already?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
No. But I have hopes of the Summer. Once more I mean to do some real work.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, it's about time.&#8212;I have made out the schedule for our walking tour, by the by. And I brought along the map. Look here. We start from Niederdorf, and then by way of Pl&#228;tzwiesen to Schluderbach; then to Cortina; then through the Giau Pass to Caprile; then by way of the Fedaja<a href="#note2a" name="noteref2a"><sup><span class="small">2</span></sup></a>....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
I leave all that to you. I rely entirely on you.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Then it's settled that we'll don knapsack and alpenstock once more, to wander through the country as we used to do when we were young...?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, and I am looking forward to it with a great deal of pleasure.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
You need simply to pull yourself together&#8212;a few weeks of mountain air and quiet will get you out of this.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I haven't got into anything in particular. I am a little nervous. That's all.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Can't you see, Amadeus, how you have to force yourself in order to use this evasion toward me, who, of course, has no right whatever to demand any frankness? Can't you see how you are wasting a part of your mental energy, so to speak, on this slight disingenuousness? No, dissimulation is utterly foreign to your nature, as I have always told you. If you should ever get to the point where you had to deceive one who was near and dear to you, that would be the end of you.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Your worry is quite superfluous! Haven't you known us long enough&#8212;me and Cecilia&#8212;to know that our marriage is based, above all else, on absolute frankness?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Many have good intentions, but their courage often deserts them at the critical moment.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
We have never yet kept anything hidden from each other.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Because so far you have had nothing to confess.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, a great deal, perhaps, which other people keep to themselves. Our common life has not been without its complications. We have had to be parted from each other for months at a time. I have had to rehearse in private with other singers than Philine, and (<i>with an air of superiority</i>) other men than Prince Sigismund must have discovered that Cecilia is pretty.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
I haven't said a word about Cecilia.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
And besides, it would be quite hopeless for Cecilia or me to keep any secrets. We know each other too well&#8212;I don't think two people ever existed who understood each other so completely as we do.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
I can imagine a point where the understanding would have to end, and everything else with it.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Everything else maybe&#8212;but not the understanding.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, well! If nothing is left but the understanding, that means the beginning of the end.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Those are&#8212;chances that every human being must resign himself to take.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
You don't talk like one who has resigned himself, however, but like one who has made up his mind.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Who can be perfectly sure of himself or of anybody else? We two, at any rate, are not challenging fate by feeling too secure.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, when it comes to that, my dear fellow&#8212;fate always regards itself challenged&#8212;by doubt no less than by confidence.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
To be safe against any surprise brings a certain sense of tranquillity anyhow.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
A little more tranquillity would produce a decision to avoid anything that might endanger an assured happiness.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Do you think anything is to be won by that kind of avoidance? Don't you feel rather, that the worst and most dangerous of all falsehoods is to resist temptation with a soul full of longing for it? And that it is easier to go unscathed through adventures than through desires?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Adventures...! Is it actually necessary, then, to live through them? A painter who has risen above pot-boiling, and who has left the follies of youth behind him, can be satisfied with a single model for all the figures that are created out of his dreams&#8212;and one who knows how to live may have all the adventures he could ever desire within the peaceful precincts of his own home. He can experience them just as fully as anybody else, but without waste of time, without unpleasantness, without danger. And if he only possess a little imagination, his wife may bear him nothing but illegitimate children without being at all aware of it.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
It's an open question whether you have the right to force such a part on anybody whom you respect.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
It is not wise to let people know what they mean to you. I have put this thought into an aphorism:

Just as you say, Cecilia. I won't intrude, of course. But a moment ago you said that you felt more certain of yourself when I was within reach. And as far as my work is concerned, I don't think&#8212;Albert and I were just talking of it&#8212;nothing will come of it until the season is over.

That's what I suspected.

<p>
AMADEUS

But during the summer I'll complete my Fourth. I must have something new to conduct this year. And it's only a question of the final passages, for that matter. All the rest is as good as finished&#8212;in my mind at least.

It's a long time since you let me hear anything of it.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS

It hasn't quite reached the point where it can be played. But, of course, you know the principal themes ... the Allegro ... and then the Intermezzo.... (<i>He goes to the piano and strikes a few notes</i>)

So you are going next November?

Yes, for three months.

And during October I shall be in Berlin.

AMADEUS

Oh ... is there any news in that matter?
</p>
<p>

Yes, I have practically closed. Reichenbach came to see me at the opera-house. I'm to appear in three parts. As Carmen under all circumstances. The other two are left to my own choice.

Yes, Wedius. I know him. He was in Dresden when I was there.&#8212;Carmen, then, and Tatyana, and...?

Why not? I couldn't say no to Marie. Have you any objection?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS

No&#8212;why should I? But we might use the half hour that's left to go over something. (<i>He goes to the music-stand</i>) What do you want to sing?

Yes. And perhaps von Wolf's "Concealment," and something by Brahms. "No more to meet you, was my firm decision...."

Yes, I was just holding it in my hand. (<i>As if casually, and very dryly</i>) So you went for a walk with Sigismund after all?

Yes. He sent his regards to you.

Did he? (<i>As he brings the music sheets to the piano</i>) Why doesn't he come here instead?

Is that so?&#8212;Oh, well!&#8212;I'll send him my regards, too. But it's really too bad that he won't come here any more. It was very nice to hear him play his waltzes&#8212;those evenings were really very pleasant.... I just happened to mention them to the Countess this afternoon.

Her picture?

I went with Sigismund to the Art Gallery.

Oh.&#8212;They tell me it's a great success.

It would be a wonder if it were not. The artist spent six months on it, they say....

What were we talking of...? (<i>Pause</i>) It's so hard to recall the words.... (<i>As she goes slowly to the fireplace</i>) And they have such a different sound when recalled in that way.

True indeed. (<i>Coming nearer to her</i>) And I don't suppose it's the words that matter.... Well, Cecilia, can it be possible that you have nothing more to tell me?

Not for people like us.

Not quite, perhaps. I know. But this shouldn't be a reason for either one of us to refuse telling the other one. Scruples of that kind would be unworthy of ourselves. This is

Am I to tell you

</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
<i>
That
</i>
time is long past.&#8212;And you have probably forgotten what it was like. On the whole, it must be the same thing, I suppose. Only you have grown a little older since then, and you have been living with me for seven years.... No matter how far apart we may have been, you have been living
<i>
with me</i>&#8212;and we have a child....
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, perhaps that's what makes the difference&#8212;but there

is
</i>
a difference.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
What really matters is nothing new, however. You feel attracted to him, don't you?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA (<i>speaking with genuine feeling and almost tenderly</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
But perhaps there is still something that holds back&#8212;that could hold me back, if it only wanted.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS (<i>after a pause, brusquely</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
But it doesn't want to ... it doesn't dare to want it. What sense could there be in it? Perhaps I might prove the stronger to-day&#8212;and the next time, perhaps&#8212;but sooner or later the day must come nevertheless, when I should suffer defeat.

Why?... It ought not to be necessary!

And then, even if I remained victorious every time&#8212;could that be called happiness for which I must fight repeatedly and tremble all the time? Could that be called happiness in our case, who have known what is so much better?... No, Cecilia, our love should not be permitted to end in mutual distrust. I don't hold you, Cecilia, if you are attracted elsewhere&#8212;and you have known all the time that I would never hold you.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Maybe you are right, Amadeus. But is it pride alone that makes you let me slip away so easily?

Is it love alone that brings you back when almost gone? (<i>Pause; he goes to the window</i>)

Why should we spoil these hours with bitterness, Amadeus? After all, we have nothing to reproach each other for. We have promised to be honest with each other, and

my

word has been kept so far.
</p>

AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
And so has mine. If you want it, I can tell you exactly what I and the Countess talked of to-day, as I have always done. And for

me</i>, Cecilia, it will even be possible to recall the very words.

I know enough. (<i>Pause</i>)

AMADEUS (<i>walking to and fro until he stops some distance away from her</i>) And what next?

<p class="indent">
What next...? Perhaps it's just as well that our vacations are soon to begin. Then we may consider in peace, each one by himself, what is to come next.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>

It seems almost as if both of us should have expected this very thing. We have made no common plans for the summer, although we have always done so before.

CECILIA

The best thing for me is probably to go with the boy to some quiet place in the Tirol ... as you and Albert suggested.

Yes.

CECILIA

<p class="indent">
And you...?

I...? I shall make that walking tour with Albert. I want to be scrambling about in the mountains once more.

And finally descend into some beautiful valley&#8212;is that what you mean?

That&#8212;might happen.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA (<i>dryly</i>)

But

first</i>&#8212;we should have to bid each other definite good-by, as there is no return from

<p class="indent">
Of course, there isn't! No more than from your place.

From mine...?

What moment?

Well&#8212;the one we used to foresee in our happiest days even&#8212;the one we have expected as something almost inevitable.

Yes, it has come. We know now that everything is over.

<p>
AMADEUS

Over...?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA

<p class="indent">
That's what we have been talking of all the time, I suppose.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, you are right. At bottom it is better that we put it into plain words at last. Our moods have been rather too precarious lately.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Everything will be improved now.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Improved...? Why?... Oh, of course ... perhaps you are right. I feel almost as if things had already begun to improve. It's strange, but ... one ... seems to breathe more freely.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, Amadeus, now we are reaping the reward of always having been honest. Think how exhausted most people would be in a moment like this&#8212;by all sorts of painful evasions, labored truces, and pitifully sentimental reconciliations. Think of the hostile spirit in which they would be facing each other during their moment of belated candor. We two, Amadeus&#8212;we shall at least be able to part as friends. (<i>Pause</i>)

And our boy?

No, there are many things. How is it going to be arranged anyhow?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>

That's what we shall have to discuss carefully during the next few days&#8212;before we go away. Until then everything must remain as before. It can perfectly well remain as it has been during the last year. That involves no wrong to anybody. (<i>Pause</i>)

Capriccio doloroso</i>. It is peculiar how one often fails to understand one's own ideas to begin with. The hidden sadness of that theme has been revealed to me by you.

Oh, you would have discovered it yourself, Amadeus.

Maybe. (<i>Pause</i>) And whom will you get for the studying of your parts next year?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I'll always find somebody. Those numbers for the concert&#8212;you'll help me with those just the same, won't you? And I hope you'll be kind enough to give me the accompaniment at the concert too.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's a foregone conclusion.&#8212;But I should really like to know who is to assist you with your studies after this.

Do you regard that as the most important problem to be solved?

No, of course not. The less so, as I don't quite see why I shouldn't go on helping you as before.

Oh, you think...? But then we should have to agree on hours and conditions.

That was not meant as a joke, Cecilia. Seeing that we are parting in a spirit of perfect understanding, why shouldn't such an arrangement be considered tentatively at least?

Those things will probably settle themselves later on.... That we ... that you play my accompaniment at a concert ... or help me to study a part....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why later on?... (<i>He rises and stands leaning against the piano</i>) There can be no reasonable ground for changing our musical relationships. I think both of us would suffer equally from doing so. Without overestimating myself, I don't think it likely that you can find a better coach than I am. And as for my compositions, I don't know of anybody who could understand them better&#8212;with whom I would rather discuss them than with you.

And yet that's what you will have to come to.

<p class="indent">
I can't see it. And&#8212;leaving our artistic relations entirely aside&#8212;there is much else to be considered&#8212;things of more importance. Our boy, Cecilia. Why should the youngster all at once be made fatherless, so to speak?

That's entirely out of the question. We must come to an understanding, of course.

You suggest things that simply can't be done.

I don't feel like you about that.&#8212;On the contrary! The more I consider our situation calmly, the more irrational it seems to me that we should part ways like any ordinary divorced couple ... that we should give up the beautiful home we have in common....

Oh, of course, we shall.

AMADEUS

Well, then! The things that bind us together are so compelling, after all, that any new experiences brought by our freedom must seem absolutely unessential in comparison. Don't you realize that as I do? And

we

shouldn't have to consider what people may say. I think we have the right to place ourselves on a somewhat higher level. In the last instance, we must always belong together, even if a single tie should be severed among the hundreds that unite us. Or are we all of a sudden to forget what we have been to each other&#8212;as well as what we may and should be to each other hereafter? One thing remains certain: that no one else will ever understand you as I do, and no one me as you do.... And that's what counts in the end! So why shouldn't we....

All right. We'll discuss everything frankly, just as we have been doing&#8212;nay, we shall have more things than ever to discuss. Truth becomes now the natural basis of our continued relationship&#8212;truth without any reservation whatsoever. And that should prove highly profitable, not only to our mutual relationship, but to each one of us individually. Because ... you don't think, do you, that either one of us could find a better chum than the other one?... Now we shall bring our joys and sorrows to each other. We shall be as good friends as ever, if not better still. And our hands shall be joined, even if chasms open between us. And thus we shall keep all that we have had in common hitherto: our work, our child, our home&#8212;all that we must continue to have in common if it is to retain its full value to both of us. And we shall gain many new things for which both of us have longed&#8212;things in which I could take no pleasure, by the way, if I had to lose you.

Why not? I am always working. And I have never in my life been more eager about it. I, too, am having a brilliant period. For years I have not been doing better. And I am no less industrious than Cecilia. With the difference that regular hours are not in my line&#8212;nine to nine-forty-five, twelve to twelve-thirty, and so on. But you ask Albert!

That wasn't the point.

What circumstances are you talking of anyhow?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
My dear fellow, I should never have dreamt of forcing myself into your confidence, but as the matter has already got into the papers....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
What has got into the papers?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Haven't you read that thing in the New Journal to-night?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
What thing?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
That Cecilia and Prince Sigismund.... But, of course, you are familiar with the main facts?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
I'm familiar with nothing. What is in the New Journal?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Just a brief notice&#8212;without any names, but not to be mistaken.... It reads something like this: "One of our foremost artists, who has just been celebrating triumphs in the metropolis of an adjoining state ... until now the wife of a gifted musician" ... or perhaps it was "highly gifted" ... and so on ... and so on ... "and a well-known Austrian gentleman, belonging to our oldest nobility, intend, we are told ..." and so on....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Cecilia and the Prince...?!
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes ... and then a hint that, in such a case, it would not prove very difficult to obtain a dispensation from the Pope....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Has everybody gone crazy?... I can assure you that not a word of it is true!... You won't believe me?... I hope you don't think I would deny it, if.... Or do you actually mean that Cecilia might have ... from me.... Oh, dear, and you are supposed to be a friend of ours, a student of the human soul, and a poet!
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
I beg your pardon, but after what has happened it would not seem improbable....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Not improbable...? It is simply impossible! Cecilia has never thought of it!
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
However, it ought not to surprise you that such a rumor has been started.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Nothing surprises me. But I feel as if the relationship between Cecilia and myself were being profaned by tittle-tattle of that kind.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Pioneers like yourself must scorn the judgment of the world. Else they are in danger of being proved mere braggarts.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I am no pioneer. The whole thing is a private arrangement between me and Cecilia, which gives us both the greatest possible comfort. Be kind enough, at least, to tell the people who ask you, that we are not going to be divorced&#8212;but that, on the other hand, we are not deceiving each other, as it is asserted in these scrawls with which I have been bombarded for some time. (<i>He indicates the letter which arrived at the same time as Cecilia's</i>)
</p>
<p class="hang">
ALBERT (<i>picks up the letter, glances through it, and puts it away again</i>) An anonymous letter...? Well, that's part of it....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Explain to them, please, that there can be no talk of deceit where no lies have been told. Tell them that Cecilia's and my way of keeping faith with each other is probably a much better one than that practiced in so many other marriages, where both go their own ways all day long and have nothing in common but the night. You are a poet, are you not&#8212;and a student of the human soul? Well, why don't you make all this clear to the people who refuse to understand?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
To convey all that would prove a rather complicated process. But if it means so much to you, I could make a play out of it. Then they would have no trouble in comprehending this new kind of marriage&#8212;at least between the hours of eight-thirty and ten.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Are you so sure of that?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Absolutely. In a play I can make the case much clearer than it is presented by reality&#8212;without any of those superfluous, incidental side issues, which are so confusing in life. The main advantage is, however, that no spectators attend the entr'acts, so that I can do just what I please with you during those periods. And besides, I shall make you offer an analogy illuminating the whole case.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
An analogy, you say...?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, analogies always have a very soothing effect. You will remark to a friend&#8212;or whoever may prove handy&#8212;something like this: "What do you want me to do anyhow? Suppose that Cecilia and I were living in a nice house, where we felt perfectly comfortable, and which had a splendid view that pleased us very much, and a wonderful garden where we liked to take walks together. And suppose that one of us should feel a desire sometime to pick strawberries in the woods beyond the fence. Should that be a reason for the other one to raise a cry all at once about faithlessness, or disgrace, or betrayal? Should that force us to sell the house and garden, or make us imagine that we could never more look out of the window together, or walk under our splendid trees? Merely because our strawberries happened to be growing on the other side of the fence..."
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
And you would make me say that?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Do you fear it's too brilliant for you?&#8212;Oh, that wouldn't occur to anybody. Trust me to fix it. In such a play I can do nothing whatever with your musical talent. You see, I can't let you conduct your symphony for the benefit of the public. And so I get both myself and you out of it by putting into your character a little more sense and energy and consistency....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Than God has given me originally.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, it's not very hard to compete with Him!
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
I shall certainly be curious about one thing: how you mean to end that play.
</p>
<p class="hang">
ALBERT (<i>after a brief pause</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Not very happily, my dear fellow.
</p>
<p class="hang">
AMADEUS (<i>a little staggered</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why?
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
It is characteristic of all transitional periods, that a conflict which might not exist to a later generation, must end tragically the moment a fairly decent person becomes involved in it.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
But there is no conflict.
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
I shall not shirk the duty of inventing one.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Suppose you wait a little while yet...? Perhaps life itself might....
</p>
<p>
ALBERT
</p>
<p class="indent">
My dear chap, I am not at all interested in what may be done with us by this ridiculous reality which has to get along without stage manager or prompter&#8212;this reality which frequently never gets to the fifth act, merely because the hero happens to be struck on the head by a brick in the second. I make the curtain rise when the plot takes a diverting turn, and I drop it the moment I have proved myself in the right.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Please, my dear fellow, don't forget when writing your play, to introduce a figure on which reality in this case has lavished much more care than on the hero&#8212;I mean, the fool.

You can't insult me in that way. I have always regarded myself as closely akin to him.

He got there two days after me, as I told you in my letters.

You're doing a lot for his general education, I must say.&#8212;But I should like to know by what fraud Sigismund got himself into that reception of the Director's.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
By what fraud?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, you wrote me that he created a regular sensation with those waltzes of his.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
So he did. But he didn't have to use fraud to get in. Being a nephew of the Baroness, there was no reason why he should resort to such methods.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, yes, I didn't remember that.

And by the way, the Director asked very eagerly about you.

He thinks a great deal of me....

AMADEUS (<i>as if meaning no offense</i>)

AMADEUS

<p class="indent">
Yes, it's incredible what the popular gossip can invent. It's even in the newspapers. His Highness the Prince Sigismund Maradas-Lohsenstein is going to lead you to the altar. The necessary dispensation will be furnished by the Pope. Idiotic&#8212;isn't it?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes.&#8212;But, my dear, you say nothing about what is still more idiotic.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
And what can that be?
</p>
<p>

<p class="indent">
That you are on the verge of believing this piece of idiocy.

I...? How can you.... Oh, no!

Well, if it's nothing but those three years of difference in....

No, it isn't that. No, indeed! Even if I were younger than he, I should never think of it.

How could I know, Amadeus? There are prospects of so many kinds.
</p>
<p class="hang">
AMADEUS (<i>cowering a moment before those words</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, that's true. Life is full of prospects. Everywhere, wherever you turn, there are temptations and promises&#8212;when you have determined to be free, and to take life lightly, as we have done.... That's what you meant, was it not?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, precisely.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Tell me, Cecilia.... (<i>He draws closer to her</i>) There is one thing I should like to know&#8212;whether Sigismund has any idea that your mind is harboring such thoughts&#8212;which, after all, would appear rather weird to the other party concerned.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Sigismund...? How can you imagine?! Such things you admit only to your friends. (<i>She gives her hand to him</i>)
</p>
<p class="hang">
AMADEUS (<i>in the same friendly manner</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
But if he should notice anything ... although I think it very improbable that he is the kind of man who would.... But let us suppose that he concluded from various signs that some such thoughts were passing through your head&#8212;would you deny them, if he asked you?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I believe myself capable of it.
</p>
<p class="hang">
AMADEUS (<i>with a shrinking</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh.... Let me tell you, Cecilia.... You are having something definite in mind.... Yes, I am sure of it.... It's a question of some definite prospect.
</p>
<p class="hang">
CECILIA (<i>smiling</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
That might be possible.

What has happened, Cecilia?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA

<p class="indent">
Nothing.

<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Then there is danger in the air.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA

Danger...? What could that mean to us? To him who has no obligations there can be no cause for fear.

<p class="hang">
AMADEUS (<i>taking her lightly by the arm</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Stop playing with words! I can see through the whole thing just the same.&#8212;I know! It has been brought home to me by a number of passages in your letters&#8212;although they ceased long ago to have the frankness due to our friendship. That new prospect is Wedius!
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
In what respect did my letters fail to be frank? Didn't I write you immediately after the "Onyegin" performance, that there was something fascinating about his personality?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
So you have said before, of many people. But there was never any such prospect implied in it.
</p>

Everything begins to take on new meanings when you are free.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS

You are not telling me everything.... What has happened?

No!... Indeed, no! The spell has been broken ... it seems....

CECILIA (<i>rising</i>)

My dear Amadeus, I am really too tired to discuss that matter to-day. Now I shall say good-night to you. It is quite late. (<i>She holds out her hand to him</i>)
</p>

AMADEUS (<i>faltering</i>)

Good-night, Cecilia!... (<i>He clings to her hand</i>) You have been gone three weeks. I shall leave early the day after to-morrow&#8212;and when

I

return, you will be gone, I suppose.... There can't be so very much to your friendship, if you won't stay and talk a while with me under such circumstances.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
What's the use of being sentimental? Leave-takings are familiar things to us.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's true. But nevertheless this will be a new kind of leave-taking, and a new kind of home-coming also.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, seeing that it had to turn out this way....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
But neither of us ever imagined that it would turn out this way.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, Cecilia, we did
<i>
not
</i>
imagine it. The remarkable thing has been that we retained our faith in each other in the midst of all doubts, and that, even when away from each other, we used to feel calm and confident far beyond what was safe, I suppose. But it was splendid. Separation itself used to have a sort of charm of its own&#8212;<i>formerly</i>.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Naturally. It isn't possible to love in that undisturbed fashion except when you are miles apart.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
You may be able to make fun of it to-day, Cecilia, but there will never again be anything like it&#8212;neither for you nor for me. You can be sure of that.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I know that as well as you do.&#8212;But why should you all at once begin to talk as if, somehow, everything would be over between us two, and as if the best part of our life had been irretrievably lost? That's not the case, after all. It cannot possibly be the case. Both of us know that we remain the same as before&#8212;don't we&#8212;and that everything else that has happened to us, or may happen to us, can be of no particular importance.... And even if it should become important, we shall always be able to join hands, no matter what chasms open between us.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
You speak very sensibly, as usual.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
If you seduce ladies by the dozen, and if gentlemen shoot each other dead for my sake&#8212;as they do for the sake of Countess Philine&#8212;what has that to do with our friendship?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's beyond contradiction. Nevertheless, I hadn't expected&#8212;in fact, I think it nothing less than admirable&#8212;your ability to adjust yourself to everything&#8212;your way of remaining perfectly calm in the midst of any new experiences or expectations.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Calm...? Here I am ... by our fireplace ... taking tea in your company. Here I can and shall always be calm. That's the significance of our whole life in common. Whatever may be my destiny in the world at large will slip off me when I enter here. All the storms are on the outside.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's more than you can be sure of, Cecilia. Things might happen that would weigh more heavily on you than you can imagine at this moment.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I shall always have the strength to throw off things according to my will before I come to you. And if that strength should ever fail me, I shall come to the door and no farther.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, no, you mustn't! That would not be in keeping with our agreement. It is just when life grows heavy that I'll be here to help you bear it.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Who knows whether you will always be ready to do so?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Always&#8212;on my oath! No matter what befall you, whether it be sad or wretched, you can always find refuge and sympathy with me. But with all my heart I wish you may be spared most of those things.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
That I be spared...? No, Amadeus, a wish like that I can't accept. Hitherto&#8212;I have lived so little hitherto. And I am longing for it. I long for all that's sad and sweet in life, for all that's beautiful and all that's pitiful. I long for storms, for perils&#8212;for worse than that, perhaps.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, Cecilia, that's nothing but imagination!

<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, no!
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Certainly, Cecilia. You don't know very much as yet, and you imagine many things simpler and cleaner than they are. But there are things you couldn't stand, and others of which you are not capable.&#8212;I know you, Cecilia.

<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
You know me?&#8212;You know only what I have been to you&#8212;what I have been as your beloved and your wife. And as you used to mean the whole world to me&#8212;as all my longing, all my tenderness, was bounded by you&#8212;we could never guess in those days what might prove my destiny when the real world was thrown open to me.&#8212;Even to-day, Amadeus, I am no longer the same as before.... Or perhaps I have always been the same as I am now, but didn't know it merely. And something has fallen away, that used to cover me up in the past.... Yes, that's it: for now I can feel all those desires that used to pass me by as if deflected by a cuirass of insensibility.... Now I can feel how they touch my body and my soul, filling me with qualms and passions. The earth seems full of adventure. The sky seems radiant with flames. And it is as if I could see myself stand waiting with wide-open arms.

AMADEUS

Nothing.... The words you speak cannot estrange me after all that I have learned already. But there is a new ring in your voice that I have never heard until to-day. Nor have I ever seen that light in your eyes until to-day.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's what you imagine, Amadeus. If that were really the case, then I should feel the same in regard to you. But I can see no difference in you at all. And I can't imagine how you possibly could come to seem different. To other women you may appear a mischiefmaker&#8212;or a silly youth&#8212;which has probably happened many times: but to me you will always remain the same as ever. And I have a feeling that, in the last instance, nothing can ever happen to the Amadeus I am thinking of.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
If I could only feel the same&#8212;in regard to you! But such assurance is not mine. The recklessness and greed with which you make your way into an unknown world are filling me with outright fear on your behalf. The idea that there are people who know as little of you as you of them at this moment, and to whom you are going to belong...

AMADEUS

<p class="indent">
... who are part of your destiny already, as you of theirs ... it seems to me uncanny. And you are no more the Cecilia I used to love&#8212;no! You resemble closely one who was very dear to me, and yet you are not at all the same as she. No, you are not the woman that was my wife for years. I could feel it the moment you entered the place.... The connection between the young girl who sank into my arms one evening seven years ago and the woman who has just returned from abroad to dwell for a brief while in this house seems quite mysterious. For seven years I have been living with another woman&#8212;with a quiet, kindly woman&#8212;with a sort of angel perhaps, who has now disappeared. She who came to-day has a voice that I have never heard, a look that I am foreign to, a beauty that is strange to me&#8212;a beauty not surpassing what the other had, except in being more cruel possibly&#8212;and yet a beauty that should confer much greater happiness, I think.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Don't look at me like that!... Don't talk to me like that!... That's not the way to talk to a friend! Don't forget I am no more the one I used to be. When you talk to me like that, Amadeus, it is as if here, too, I should be fanned by those cajoling breaths that nowadays so often touch me like caresses&#8212;breaths that make life seem incredibly light, and that make you feel ready for so much that formerly would have appeared incomprehensible.

The same room. It is the morning of the following day. The stage is empty at first. Then Amadeus enters from his room at the left. He wears a dressing-gown, but is otherwise fully dressed. He passes slowly and pensively across the room to the writing desk, from which he picks up the waiting pile of letters. Then he puts the letters down again. He feels chilly, looks around, notices that a window is open, and goes to close it. Then he stands listening for a while at the door to Cecilia's room. Finally he returns to the writing desk and begins to pull out manuscripts from its drawers.

And why not? Let her find out ... right now ... I am going to have it out with her. Yes, indeed. (<i>Rising</i>) One can't write a thing of that kind. I'll tell her everything. I'll tell her that I can't bear it&#8212;that it drives me crazy to think of the other fellow. And she'll understand. And even if she should plead with me to forgive her ... even if she ... oh! (<i>He goes to her door</i>) I must tell her at once.... Oh, I feel like choking her!... Cecilia! (<i>He knocks at her door, but gets no answer</i>) What does that mean?

The point is not that you seem funny to

And yet it had to come. Friendship between two people of different sexes is always dangerous&#8212;even when they are married. If there is too much mutual understanding between our souls, many things are swept along that we would rather keep back; and when our senses are attracted mutually, the suction affects much more of our souls than we would care to have involved. That's a universal law, my dear chap, for which the profound uncertainty of all earthly relations between man and woman must be held responsible.

Logical consequences...? Here I am talking wisdom, and you clamor for nonsense. And that's what you call logical consequences?... My opinion is rather, that you are about to behave like a perfect fool. Anybody else might do what you now propose: you are the only one who mustn't. For when you propose such a thing, it becomes illogical, ungenerous, not to say dishonest. You want to call a man to account for something which, as he sees it, has been declared explicitly permissible.... In his place I should laugh in your face. If anybody has the right to be indignant here, and to demand an account, it is the Prince himself, and nobody else&#8212;as he has not deceived you, but you him.

Well, such things are not inherited. And if he won't, I shall know how to make him. There's no other way out of it. There can be no other alternative, if I am to go on living&#8212;with or without her. That will set everything right, but nothing else will. It's the one thing that can clear the air about us. Until it is over, we dare not belong to each other again or&#8212;be happy.

Thank you.

The sole object of my visit is to put before you a proposition.

AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
I'm listening.

<p>
SIGISMUND

I don't want to waste any words. My proposition is that you get a divorce from your wife.
</p>
<p class="hang">

There is nothing I wish more eagerly.
</p>
<p>

And what is the attitude of Cecilia toward your intentions?

SIGISMUND

<p class="indent">
Not encouraging so far.
</p>
<p class="hang">
AMADEUS (<i>puzzled</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Cecilia is absolutely in a position to decide for herself. And of course, she would also have the right to leave me&#8212;whenever and howsoever it might please her to do so. For that reason you must pardon me if I find the object of your visit incomprehensible, to say the least.
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
You'll soon find it comprehensible, I think. The discouraging attitude of Mrs. Adams-Ortenburg proves nothing at all in this connection, I must say. As long as Mrs. Adams-Ortenburg has not been set free by you&#8212;even if that be done against her own will&#8212;she is, in a sense, bound to you. To get this matter fully cleared up, it seems to me necessary that you yourself, my dear Master, insist on a divorce. Mrs. Adams-Ortenburg will not be in a position to choose freely until she has been divorced from you. Until then the struggle between us two will not be on equal terms&#8212;as, I trust, you would like to have it.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
There can be no talk of any struggle here. You misunderstand the actual state of affairs in a manner that seems to me incomprehensible. For I have no right to suppose that Cecilia has made any secret of the more deep-lying reasons that have so far prevented us from considering a dissolution of our marriage.
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
Certainly, I am aware of those reasons, but to me they don't by any means seem sufficiently pressing&#8212;not even from your own viewpoint&#8212;to exclude all thought of a divorce. And I am anxious to assure you that, under all circumstances, I shall feel bound to treat those reasons with the most profound respect.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
What do you mean?
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
You know, my dear Master, that the reverence I have for your art, even if I am not always capable of grasping it, equals the admiration I feel for the singing of Mrs. Adams-Ortenburg. I know how much you two mutually owe to each other, and how you&#8212;if I may say so&#8212;complement each other musically. And it would never occur to me to put any difficulties whatsoever in the way of your continued artistic relationship. I am equally aware of the tenderness with which you regard your child&#8212;for whom, by the way, as you probably know, I have a great deal of devotion&#8212;and I can give you my word that the doors leading to the quarters of little Peter will always stand open to you.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
In other words, you would have no objection to seeing the former husband of your&#8212;of the wife&#8212;of the Princess Lohsenstein, admitted to your house as a friend?
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
Any such objection would be regarded by me as an insult to your&#8212;to my&#8212;to Mrs. Cecilia Adams-Ortenburg, as well as to you, my dear Master. With those provisions made, the new arrangement, which I am taking the liberty to suggest, would be more sensible and&#8212;if you'll allow me a frank expression&#8212;more decent than the one to which all of us now have to submit. I am convinced, my dear Master, that, when you have had chance to consider the matter calmly, you will not only agree with me, but you will be surprised that this simple solution of an unbearable situation has not occurred to yourself long ago. As for me, I want to add that, to me personally, this solution seems the only possible one. Yes, I don't hesitate to say that I would leave the city, without hope of ever seeing Mrs. Cecilia again, rather than keep on compromising her in a manner that must be equally painful to all of us.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, has it come to that all at once? Well, if the matter doesn't trouble Cecilia or me, I think
<i>
you
</i>
might well regard it with indifference. I hope you know that we have arranged our life to suit ourselves, without the least regard for popular gossip, and that I don't care at all whether or no Cecilia be compromised&#8212;as you call it.
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
I know you don't. But I feel differently. A lady to whom I'm so devoted, and whom I respect so highly that I would lead her to the altar, must appear spotless to God and man alike.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
You might have kept that in mind before. Your previous behavior has given no indication of such a view. You have been waiting for my wife in the immediate vicinity of the opera; you have been walking with her for hours at a time; you have visited her in the country; you have followed her to Berlin and come back here in her company....
</p>
<p class="hang">
SIGISMUND (<i>surprised</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
But it was in your power to stop all those things, if they didn't suit you....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Stop them ... because they didn't suit...? What has that to do with what I am talking of?&#8212;I am not the person who has found this situation unbearable and compromising.
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I understand. Considering, however, that you have placed such emphasis on your indifference to popular gossip, I must say that your tone sounds pretty excited. But permit me to assure you that this impresses me rather pleasantly. Bear in mind that I am merely human. What young man in my place would have refrained from meeting the adored one, when everything was rendered so easy for him? And nevertheless I didn't visit the Pustertal or make the tour to Berlin without an inward struggle&#8212;in fact, I have often had to struggle with myself while waiting for her near the opera. And I cannot tell you how I have suffered under the searching glances directed at Mrs. Adams-Ortenburg and myself when we were having supper together after one of the Berlin performances, for instance, or when we went for an afternoon drive in the Tiergarten.<a href="#note7a" name="noteref7a"><sup><span class="small">7</span></sup>

Later on we shall get back to what you think of me. But a third person is concerned in this matter, and I am not going to stand....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS

May I ask whether you have been equally angry with everyone who has dared to question the virtue of Mrs. Adams-Ortenburg?
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
You are at least the first one who has dared to question it to my face, and the last one who may dare to do so unpunished.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Do you think the punishment threatening the impertinent one in your mind will be apt to restore the reputation of Cecilia? Do you think it would put an end to the gossip if you, of all people, tried to champion the honor of Mrs. Adams-Ortenburg?
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND

<p class="indent">
Who could, if not I?

a comedy you are now playing, then you haven't the right even!

If you are telling the truth, Prince Sigismund, then there is only one person in the world who has the right to protect Cecilia, and that person am I.

SIGISMUND

Considering what has happened, I have excellent reason to think that you will neither avail yourself of that right nor fulfill that duty.

I mean simply that two of my friends are now on their way to your house on my behalf....
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well...?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
To demand reparation for what ... (<i>looking Sigismund straight in the eye</i>) I believed you guilty of.
</p>

AMADEUS (<i>draws a deep breath, looks long at Sigismund, and shakes his head at last</i>) No, I won't any longer.

SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
Don't misunderstand me, please. But I suppose this ends our conference, my dear Master. (<i>Looking around</i>) And yet I must admit that your rude treatment has made me feel a great deal more at ease. Isn't that strange? And in spite of the fact that, after this unexpected turn, my hopes must be held practically&#8212;I beg your pardon!&#8212;completely disposed of.... In spite of this I feel actually in much better spirits than I have done for a long time. Even if I am not to have the happiness of which I have foolishly dared to dream so long....

Oh, yes. But this is at least an acceptable conclusion. (<i>Shaking his head</i>) It seems queer!

It was indeed a strange coincidence that made you choose this particular moment....

SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
Coincidence, you say? Oh, no, there are no coincidences&#8212;as you will discover sooner or later. (<i>Pause</i>) Well, good-by then, and give my regards to Mrs. ... Adams ...
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
You can safely call her Cecilia.
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
... and tell her, please, that she mustn't be angry with me for having taken such a step without her knowledge. Of course, my going away won't surprise her. When leaving her yesterday, I told her that I couldn't continue this kind of existence.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS

She....

So that after all...!
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>

Now she won't try any longer, my dear Master. (<i>With a wistful smile</i>) I have served my purpose.

<p>
AMADEUS

<p class="indent">
What do you mean?
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, I can see now why she needed me&#8212;of course, you were not at all aware of it!
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why did she need you?
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
Simply and solely as a means of winning you back.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
What makes you think...?
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
What...? That she has succeeded.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, Sigismund&#8212;she hadn't lost me&#8212;in spite of all that had happened. In fact, I feel as if I had rather lost her than she&#8212;me.
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's awfully kind of you. But now&#8212;God be with you!

AMADEUS (<i>with something like emotion</i>)

And when shall we see you again?
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
I don't know. Perhaps never.&#8212;-Please don't imagine that I might take my own life. I shall get over it, being still young.&#8212;Oh, my dear Master, if things could only become what they used to be, so that I could sit here at the fireplace while Cecilia was singing&#8212;or hammer away at the piano after supper...!
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Don't be quite so modest, please! The fame of your piano playing has reached Berlin even, I hear.
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
So she has told you that, too?!&#8212;But you see, dear Master, all that can never come back&#8212;we could no longer feel at ease with each other.... So&#8212;never to meet again!
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Never.... Why? Perhaps I shall see you very soon alone. I am also&#8212;going away.
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
I know. We were talking of it yesterday, in the dining car. You are to conduct your&#8212;number-which-one is it now?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS

<p class="indent">
The fourth.
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
So you have got that far already?&#8212;And where are you going anyhow?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
To the Rhine district first of all; then by way of Munich to Italy&#8212;Venice, Milan, Rome.
</p>
<p>
SIGISMUND
</p>
<p class="indent">
Rome...? There we may possibly meet. But you'll have to pardon me for not coming to your concerts. So far I have not been able to understand your symphonies.... But I am sure I shall sometime! One does grow more and more clever, and sorrow and experiences in particular have a maturing influence.... "Now he's making fun of it," I suppose you are thinking. But, really, I am not in a very humorous mood. Farewell, my dear Master&#8212;and my most respectful compliments to your wife. (<i>He goes out</i>)
</p>
<p class="hang">
AMADEUS (<i>walks back and forth; takes a few deep breaths, as if relieved; goes out into the garden; returns; sits down at the piano and plays a few improvisations; gets up and goes to the writing desk, where he begins to look for something among the papers</i>) Where's that Solo? ... She's going to sing it, and I shall be present...! (<i>He seats himself at the piano again, apparently in a very happy mood</i>) Cecilia!... Cecilia!

Good-morning, Amadeus.

AMADEUS

A little late.
</p>
<p class="hang">
CECILIA (<i>smiling</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes. (<i>She takes off her hat and goes to the mirror to arrange her hair</i>)
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS

<p class="indent">
What made you get out so early?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Various things I had to attend to.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
And may one ask...?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
One may.&#8212;Look here, what I have got for you. (<i>She takes a letter from a small bag</i>)
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
What's that? (<i>He takes it</i>) What...? My letter to Philine...! Did you go to her, Cecilia?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, I felt a little nervous about it. Now I think it was rather silly of me.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
And how...?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, the simplest thing in the world! I asked her for it, and she gave it to me. It was lying in an open drawer in her writing desk&#8212;with others. I think you can call yourself lucky.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Cecilia! (<i>He tears the letter to pieces and throws these into the fireplace</i>)
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, you would never have made up your mind to demand it of her, and that would have kept me in a state of irritation. I can't have anything like that on my mind when I want to work.&#8212;And now that's settled. (<i>She turns away</i>) Then I went to the opera, too. I have had a talk with the Director. He's going to indorse my request to be set free.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Your request to be set free...?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, I shall go to Berlin on the first of January.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
But, Cecilia, we haven't talked it over yet....
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
What's the use of postponing a thing that's already settled in my own mind?&#8212;You know I never like to do that.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
But it means a whole year of separation!
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
To start with. But I think it might be just as well to prepare ourselves for a still longer period.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Do you mean to leave me, Cecilia?!
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
What else can I do, Amadeus? That ought to be as clear to you as it is to me.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
So it would have been a little while ago, Cecilia. But I have come to see our future in a different light.... Cecilia ... Sigismund has been here!
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Sigismund?!... You have talked with him?... What did he want?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS

What did he want...? Your hand.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA

<p>
AMADEUS

<p class="indent">
He is sending you his farewell greetings through me, Cecilia.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA

So that's what has put you in such a good humor all at once! (<i>Pause</i>) And if he hadn't come here?

I did. Albert was on his way to him at the time.

No, not vanity, Cecilia. I love you.
</p>
<p class="hang">
CECILIA (<i>remains wholly unresponsive</i>)
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
You can't guess, of course, what took place within me while his words were gradually bringing home the truth to me! Once more the doors of heaven have been thrown open to me!
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
The only thing you forget is that they must remain closed to me forever.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Don't say that, Cecilia. What has happened to me in the past seems so very insignificant, after all.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Insignificant, you say?&#8212;And if it had happened to me, it would have been so significant that people should have had to kill or be killed on that account? How can you think then, that I might get over it so easily?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
How can I...? Because you have proved it already. You knew just what had happened, and yet you became mine again.... You knew that I had been faithless, while you had kept your faith, and yet....
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
You say that I have kept my faith?&#8212;No, I haven't! And even if I should seem faithful to you, I have long ago ceased to be so in my own mind.
<i>
I
</i>
know the desires that have burned within me....
<i>
I
</i>
know how often my body has trembled and yearned in the presence of some man.... And what I told you last night&#8212;that I am waiting with wide-open arms, full of longings and expectations&#8212;that's true, Amadeus&#8212;no less true than it is that I am standing face to face with you now.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
If that be true, what has kept you from satisfying all your longings&#8212;you, who have been as free as I have?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I am a woman, Amadeus. And we seem to be like that. Something makes us hesitate even when we have already made up our minds.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
And because you seemed guilty in your own mind, you remained silent?... And for no other reason have you left me&#8212;me, whose sufferings you might have relieved by a single word&#8212;to believe you as guilty as myself?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Perhaps....
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
And how long did you mean to let me go on believing that?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Until it became true, Amadeus.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
But there has been enough of it now, Cecilia. It will never become true ... never after this.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Where do you get that idea, Amadeus? It is going to be true. Do you think, perhaps, that all this was meant as a kind of ordeal for you? Do you think I was playing a childish comedy in order to punish you, and that now, when you have discovered the truth prematurely, I shall sink into your arms and declare everything right again? Have you really imagined that everything could now be forgotten, and that we might resume our marriage relations at the exact point where they were interrupted? How can you possibly have wished that such might be the case&#8212;so that our marriage would be like thousands of others, where both deceive each other, and become reconciled, and deceive each other again&#8212;just as the moment's whim happens to move them?
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
We have neither deceived each other, nor become reconciled&#8212;we have been free, and have merely found each other again.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Each other, you say?... As if that were possible! What is it then, that has made me seem so desirable to you all at once? Not the fact that I am Cecilia&#8212;oh, no! But the fact that I seem to have come back another woman. And have I really become yours again? Not at all! Not unless you have grown so modest all at once that you can be satisfied with a happiness that might have fallen to somebody else perhaps, if he had merely chanced to be on hand at that particular moment.
</p>
<p class="hang">
AMADEUS (<i>shrinking back</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
But even if last night be sacrificed to this fixed idea of yours, Cecilia&#8212;it is daylight now&#8212;we are awake&#8212;and in this moment of clear light you must feel, no less than I, that we love each other, Cecilia&#8212;love as we have never loved before.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
This moment might prove deceptive&#8212;and I am sure it would. No other moment would be more apt to prove such. Do you think those many moments in which we felt our tenderness gradually ebbing away&#8212;those many moments when we felt the lure of other loves&#8212;do you think them less worthy of consideration than this one? The only thing urging us together now is our fear of the final leave-taking. And our feelings at this moment make a pretty poor sample upon which to base an eternity. I don't trust them. What has happened once, may ... nay, must repeat itself&#8212;to-morrow&#8212;or two years from now&#8212;or five ... in a more indiscreet manner, perhaps, or in a manner more tragical&#8212;but certainly in a manner to be much more regretted.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, no&#8212;never again! Now&#8212;after what I have felt and experienced lately, I can vouch for myself.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
I don't feel equally certain of myself, Amadeus.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
That doesn't scare me, Cecilia, for now I'm prepared to fight for you&#8212;now I'm worthy and capable of fighting for you. Hereafter you shall never more be left unprotected as you were in the past&#8212;my tenderness will guard you.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
But I don't want to be guarded! I shall no longer permit you to guard me! And I can no more give you any promises than I care to accept yours.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
And if I should forgo them myself&#8212;if I should risk it on a mere uncertainty?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's more than I dare&#8212;whether the risk concern you or myself ... more than I would risk even with certainty in mind. (<i>She turns away from him</i>)
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Then I cannot possibly understand you, Cecilia. What is it you want to make us pay for so dearly&#8212;yes, both of us? Is it our guilt or our happiness?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Why should either one of them be paid for? What's the use of such a word between us? Neither one of us has done anything that requires atonement. Neither one of us has any right to reproach the other one. Both of us have been free, and each one has used his freedom in accordance with his own desire and ability. I think nothing has happened but what must happen. We have trusted each other too much&#8212;or too little. We were neither made to love each other faithfully forever nor to maintain a pure friendship. Others have become resigned&#8212;I can't&#8212;and you mustn't allow yourself, Amadeus. Our experiment has failed. Let us admit our disillusionment. That can be borne. But I have no curiosity to find how it tastes when everything comes to an end in sheer loathing.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Comes to an end, you say?&#8212;But that can't be possible, Cecilia! It can't be possible that we should really leave each other&#8212;part from each other like strangers! We are still face to face&#8212;each of us can feel the closeness of the other one&#8212;and that's why you cannot yet realize what it would mean. Consider all the things that might come into your life as well as into mine during a separation of that kind&#8212;so prolonged and so void of responsibility&#8212;things that now have no place in your imagination even, and for which there could be no reparation.
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
Could they be worse than what has already befallen me? Faithfulness to each other in the ordinary sense matters least of all, I should think. And we could probably more easily find our way back to each other sometime from almost any other experience than that adventure of last night, or from a moment of self-deception like this one.
</p>
<p>
AMADEUS
</p>
<p class="indent">
Find our way back, you say...?
</p>
<p>
CECILIA
</p>
<p class="indent">
It's also possible that, after a couple of years, we won't care to do so&#8212;that everything may be over between us to such an extent that we cannot imagine it now. That's possible, I say. But if we stayed together now, everything would be over within the next few seconds. For then we should be no better than all those we have despised hitherto&#8212;the one difference being that we had arranged ourselves more comfortably than the rest.

What?... (<i>He looks from one to the other; pause</i>) Really I like that. Indeed, I do. I think both of you are splendid&#8212;but especially you, Cecilia&#8212;and, of course, there is nothing else left for you to do now.

COUNTESS MIZZIE
</h2>
<p>
<i>
The garden of Count Arpad. In the background, tall iron fence. Near the middle of this, but a little more to the right, there is a gate. In the foreground, at the left, appears the fa&#231;ade of the two-storied villa, which used to be an imperial hunting lodge about 180 years ago and was remodeled about thirty years ago. A narrow terrace runs along the main floor, which is raised above the ground. Three wide stairs lead from the terrace down to the garden. French doors, which are standing open, lead from the terrace into the drawing-room. The windows of the upper floor are of ordinary design. Above that floor appears a small balcony, to which access is had through a dormer window. This balcony holds a profusion of flowering plants. A garden seat, a small table and an armchair stand under a tree at the right, in the foreground.

It's what she has promised, or threatened, or whatever you choose to call it, these last three years.
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Three, you say? May just as well say ten. Or eighteen. Yes, indeed. In fact, since the very start of this affair between her and me. It has always been a fixed idea with her. "If ever a decent man asks me to marry him, I'll get off the stage
<i>
stante pede</i>." It was almost the first thing she told me. You have heard it yourself a couple of times. And now he's come&#8212;the one she has been waiting for&#8212;and she's to get married.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Hope he's decent at least.

Yes, you're very witty! But is that your only way of showing sympathy in a serious moment like this?

<p class="indent">
Now! (<i>He puts his hand on the Count's arm</i>)
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, I assure you, it's a serious moment. It's no small matter when you have lived twenty years with somebody&#8212;in a
<i>
near</i>-marital state; when you have been spending your best years with her, and really shared her joys and sorrows&#8212;until you have come to think at last, that it's never going to end&#8212;and then she comes to you one fine day and says: "God bless you, dear, but I'm going to get wedded on the sixteenth...." Oh, damn the whole story! (<i>He gets up and begins to walk about</i>) And I can't blame her even. Because I understand perfectly. So what can you do about it?
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
You've always been much too kind, Arpad.
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Nothing kind about it. Why shouldn't I understand? The clock has struck thirty-eight for her. And she has said adieu to her profession. So that anybody can sympathize with her feeling that there is no fun to go on as a ballet dancer retired on half pay and mistress on active service to Count Pazmandy, who'll be nothing but an old fool either, as time runs along. Of course, I have been prepared for it. And I haven't blamed her a bit&#8212;'pon my soul!
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
So you have parted as perfect friends?
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Certainly. In fact, our leave-taking was quite jolly. 'Pon my soul, I never suspected at first how tough it would prove. It's only by degrees it has come home to me. And that's quite a remarkable story, I must say....
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
What's remarkable about it?
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
I suppose I had better tell you all about it. On my way home that last time&#8212;one night last week&#8212;I had a feeling all of a sudden&#8212;I don't know how to express it ... tremendously relieved, that's what I felt. Now you are a free man, I said to myself. Don't have to drive to Mayerhof Street<a href="#note3b" name="noteref3b"><sup><span class="small">3</span></sup>
</a>
every night God grants you, merely to dine and chatter with Lolo, or just sit there listening to her. Had come to be pretty boresome at times, you know. And then the drive home in the middle of the night, and, on top of it, to be called to account when you happened to be dining with a friend in the Casino or taking your daughter to the opera or a theater. To cut it short&#8212;I was in high feather going home that night. My head was full of plans already.... No, nothing of the kind you have in mind! But plans for traveling, as I have long wanted to do&#8212;to Africa, or India, like a free man.... That is, I should have brought my little girl along, of course.... Yes, you may well laugh at my calling her a little girl still.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Nothing of the kind. Mizzie looks exactly like a young girl. Like quite a young one. Especially in that Florentine straw hat she was wearing a while ago.
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Like a young girl, you say! And yet she's exactly of an age with Lolo. You know, of course! Yes, we're growing old, Egon. Every one of us. Oh, yes.... And lonely. But really, I didn't notice it to begin with. It was only by degrees it got hold of me. The first days after that farewell feast were not so very bad. But the day before yesterday, and yesterday, as the time approached when I used to start for Mayerhof Street.... And when Peter brought in those roses a moment ago&#8212;for Lolo, of course&#8212;why, then it seemed pretty plain to me that I had become a widower for the second time in my life. Yes, my dear fellow. And this time forever. Now comes the loneliness. It has come already.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
But that's nonsense&#8212;loneliness!
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Pardon me, but you can't understand. Your way of living has been so different from mine. You have not let yourself be dragged into anything new since your poor wife died ten years ago. Into nothing of a serious nature, I mean. And besides, you have a profession, in a sense.
</p>
<p>

<p class="indent">
And no desire to do a thing, old man. That's the whole story. Since that time I haven't gone to the Casino even. Do you know what I have been doing the last few nights? I have sat under that tree with Mizzie&#8212;playing domino.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, don't you see? That's not to be lonely. When you have a daughter, and particularly such a sensible one, with whom you have always got on so well.... What does she say about your staying at home nights anyhow?
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Nothing. Besides, it has happened before, quite frequently. She says nothing at all. And what could she say? It seems to me she has never noticed anything. Do you think she can have known about Lolo?

<p class="indent">
Has she complained of me? There's no reason why you shouldn't tell me.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I am not in her confidence. She has never complained to me. And, heavens, it may never have troubled her at all. She has so long been accustomed to this quiet, retired life.
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, and she seems to have a taste for it, too. And then she used to go out a good deal until a few years ago. Between you and me, Egon, as late as three years ago&#8212;no, two years ago&#8212;I still thought she might make the plunge after all.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
What plunge? Oh, I see....
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
If you could only guess what kind of men have been paying attention to her quite recently....
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's only natural.
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
But she won't. She absolutely won't. What I mean is, that she can't be feeling so very lonely ... otherwise she would ... as she has had plenty of opportunity....
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Certainly. It's her own choice. And then Mizzie has an additional resource in her painting. It's a case like that of my blessed aunt, the late Fanny Hohenstein, who went on writing books to a venerable old age and never wanted to hear a word about marriage.
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
It may have some connection with her artistic aspirations. At times I'm inclined to look for some psychological connection between all these morbid tendencies.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Morbid, you say? But you can't possibly call Mizzie morbid.

<p>

<p class="indent">
Oh, it's all over now. But there was a time....
</p>
<p>
PRINCE

I have always found Mizzie very sensible and very well balanced. After all, painting roses and violets doesn't prove a person morbid by any means.
</p>

You don't think me such a fool that her violets and roses could make me believe.... But if you remember when she was still a young girl....

Her wanting to join the Ursuline Sisters rather than marry that nice young fellow, to whom she was as good as engaged already&#8212;and then up and away from home all at once&#8212;you might call that morbid, don't you think?

Ancient, you say? I feel as if it happened last year only. It was at the very time when my own affair with Lolo had just begun. Ah, harking back like that...! And if anybody had foretold me at the time...! You know, it really began like any ordinary adventure. In the same reckless, crazy way. Yes, crazy&#8212;that's it. Not that I want to make myself out worse than I am, but it was lucky for all of us that my poor wife had already been dead a couple of years. Lolo seemed ... my fate. Mistress and wife at the same time. Because she's such a wonderful cook, you know. And the way she makes you comfortable. And always in good humor&#8212;never a cross word.... Well, it's all over.

You may be sure he would have accepted the inevitable. That was the very time when he began his affair with Lolo. Otherwise everything might not have come off so smoothly.

Possibly not. But the fundamental thing remains, that no amount of honesty or daring could have availed in the least at the time.

It's doubtful whether a dispensation could have been obtained&#8212;and besides, the Princess would never have agreed to a divorce&#8212;which you know as well as I do.

Not in the least. Is that new to you? Didn't I tell you so at the time? Oh, you'll never guess what might ... (<i>her words emphasized by her glance</i>) what I ... of what I might have been capable at that time. I would have followed you anywhere&#8212;everywhere&#8212;even as your mistress. I and the child. To Switzerland, to America. After all, we could have lived wherever it happened to suit us. And perhaps, if you had gone away, they might never even have noticed your absence in the Upper House.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, of course, we might have run away and settled down somewhere abroad.... But do you still believe that a situation like that would have proved agreeable in the long run, or even bearable?
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, I don't nowadays. Because, you see, I know you now. But at that time I was in love with you. And it is possible that I&#8212;might have gone on loving you for a long time, had you not proved too

to assume the responsibility for what had happened.... Yes, too much of a coward, Prince Egon.
</p>
<p>

<p class="indent">
Whether that be the proper word....
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, I don't know of any other. There was no hesitation on my part. I was ready to face everything&#8212;with joy and pride. I was ready to be a mother, and to confess myself the mother of our child. And you knew it, Egon. I told you so seventeen years ago, in that little house in the woods where you kept me hidden. But half-measures have never appealed to me. I wanted to be a mother in every respect or not at all. The day I had to let the boy be taken away from me, I made up my mind never more to trouble myself about him. And for that reason I find it ridiculous of you to bring him here all of a sudden. If you'll allow me to give you a piece of good advice, you'll go and meet him, as papa has gone to meet Lolo&#8212;and take him back home again.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I wouldn't dream of doing so. After what I have just had to hear from you again, it seems settled that his mother must remain dead. And that means that I must take still better care of him. He is my son in the eyes of the world too. I have adopted him.
</p>

To-morrow he will probably be able to assume my name. I shall introduce him wherever it suits me. And of course, first of all to my old friend&#8212;your father. If you should find the sight of him disagreeable, there will be nothing left for you but to stay in your room while he is here.

My bad temper...? Do I look it? Really, if you please ... I have simply permitted myself to find this fancy of yours in rather poor taste. Otherwise my temper is just as good as ever.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I have no doubt of your good humor under ordinary circumstances.... I am perfectly aware, for that matter, that you have managed to become reconciled to your fate. I, too, have managed to submit to a fate which, in its own way, has been no less painful than yours.
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
In what way? To what fate have you had to submit...? Everybody can't become a cabinet minister. Oh, I see ... that remark must refer to the fact that His Highness did me the honor ten years ago, after the blissful departure of his noble spouse, to apply for my hand.

Oh, yes, I do remember. Nor have I ever given you any cause to question my good memory.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
And I hope you have never ascribed my proposals to anything like a desire to expiate some kind of guilt. I asked you to become my wife simply because of my conviction that true happiness was to be found only by your side.
</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">
True happiness!... Oh, what a mistake!
</p>
<p>

Yes, I do believe that it was a mistake at that moment. Ten years ago it was probably still too early. And so it was, perhaps, seven years ago. But not to-day.
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, to-day too, my dear Prince. Your fate has been never to know me, never to understand me at all&#8212;no more when I loved you than when I hated you, and not even during the long time when I have been completely indifferent toward you.
</p>
<p>
PRINCE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I have always known you, Mizzie. I know more about you than you seem able to guess. Thus, for instance, I am not unfamiliar with the fact that you have spent the last seventeen years in more profitable pursuits than weeping over a man who, in all likelihood, was not worthy of you at the time in question. I am even aware that you have chosen to expose yourself to several disillusionments subsequent to the one suffered at my hands.
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Disillusionments, you say? Well, for your consolation, my dear Prince, I can assure you that some of them proved very enjoyable.

I know that, too. Otherwise I should hardly have dared to call myself familiar with the history of your life.

MIZZIE

And do you think that I am not familiar with yours? Do you want me to present you with a list of your mistresses? From the wife of the Bulgarian attach&#233; in 1887 down to Mademoiselle Therese Gr&#233;dun&#8212;if that be her real name&#8212;who retained the honors of her office up to last Spring at least. It seems likely that I know more than you even, for I can give you a practically complete list of those with whom she has deceived you.

A hundred years ago these grounds were still used for hunting. The place adjoins the Tiergarten, you know. Look over that wall there, Philip. And our villa was a hunting lodge once, belonging to the Empress Maria Theresa. The stone figure over there goes back to that period.

Next October I shall begin my year as volunteer with the Sixth Dragoons, which is the regiment in which we Ravensteins always serve. And what's going to happen after that&#8212;whether I stay in the army or become an archbishop&#8212;in due time, of course....
</p>

That would probably be the best thing. The Ravensteins have always been strong in the faith.
</p>
<p>
PHILIP

<p class="indent">
Yes, it's mentioned in the Universal History even. They were Catholic at first; then they turned Protestant in the Thirty Years War; and finally they became Catholic again&#8212;but they always remained strong in their faith. It was only the faith that changed.

Good morning, my dear Professor, and how are you? You have to pardon me. I was just about to go to the telephone&#8212;we are going away, you know.
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, are you going away? Please, don't let me detain you.
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
I suppose I shall see you later, Professor. (<i>He goes into the house</i>)

<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
So you are going away, Countess?
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, to Ostend.
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
That's rather a sudden decision.
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes, rather. But that's my way.
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
That means an end to the lessons for the present, I suppose? Too bad.
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I don't think I shall be able to-day even ... I am feeling a little upset.
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
Do you?&#8212;Well, you look rather pale, Maria.
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, you think so?
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
And how long will you be gone?
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Until the Fall probably&#8212;perhaps until very late in the Fall even.
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
Then we can resume our lessons next November at the earliest, I suppose?
</p>

I don't think we shall....

PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, you don't think so? (<i>They look hard at each other</i>)
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
No, I don't.
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
Which means, Maria&#8212;that I am discharged.
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
How can you put it that way, Rudolph? That is not quite fair.
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
Pardon me. But it really came a little more suddenly than I had expected.
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Better that than have it come too slow. Don't you think so?
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, girl, I have no intention whatever to make any reproaches.
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Well, you have no reason. And it wouldn't be nice either. (<i>She holds out her hand to him</i>)
</p>
<p class="hang">
PROFESSOR (<i>takes her hand and kisses it</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Will you please excuse me to the Count?
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Are you going already...?
</p>
<p class="hang">
PROFESSOR (<i>unconcernedly</i>)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Isn't that better?
</p>
<p class="hang">
MIZZIE (<i>after a pause, during which she looks straight into his eyes</i>) Yes, I think so. (<i>They shake hands</i>)
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
Good luck, Maria.
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Same to you.... And remember me to your wife and the children.
</p>
<p>
PROFESSOR
</p>
<p class="indent">
I won't forget, Countess. (<i>He goes out</i>)

Everything is ready. We'll leave at nine-thirty to-morrow night.&#8212;But what has become of the professor?
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
I sent him away.
</p>
<p>
COUNT
</p>
<p class="indent">
Oh, you did?&#8212;And can you guess who has the compartment between yours and mine?... Egon and his young gentleman. Won't they be surprised though?
</p>
<p>
MIZZIE
</p>
<p class="indent">
Yes ... won't they? (<i>She goes into the house</i>)

The Prater is at once the Central Park and the Coney Island of Vienna, plus a great deal more&#8212;a park with an area of 2,000 acres bounded by the Danube on one side and by the Danube Canal on the other, full of all kinds of amusement places.

The place where the Turks fortified themselves before driven from Vienna by John Sobieski in 1683 is now a small park, "<i>T&#252;rkenschanz-Park</i>," located in D&#246;bling, one of the northwestern quarters of Greater Vienna. Only a little ways south of this park, and overlooking it, stands the Astronomical Observatory, not far from which Schnitzler has been living for a number of years. Numerous references to localities in this play indicate that he has placed the Wegrat home in that very villa quarter of W&#228;hring, where he himself is so thoroughly at home.

The names used in this passage occur a number of times in the various plays, indicating that their author probably has been drawing on experiences obtained during his own walking tours through the Dolomites. As far as Cortina, the route is identical with the one mentioned by
<i>
Wegrath
</i>
in "The Lonely Way." The Giau Pass is a little known footpath across Monte Giau, showing that the intention of
<i>
Albert
</i>
is to avoid the routes frequented by tourists.

Innsbruck is the capital of the province of Tirol. Krems is a small city on the Donau, not so very far from Vienna, having a fine high school or "gymnasium." The idea is, of course, that as the boy grew up, his father became more and more interested and wanted to have him within easier reach.

"Neben der Wiesinger-Florian." The name is slightly misspelt in the German text. It is that of Mrs. Olga Wisinger-Florian, a well-known Viennese painter of floral pieces, whose work is represented in many of the big galleries in Europe. She was born in 1844, made her name in the early eighties, and is still living.
